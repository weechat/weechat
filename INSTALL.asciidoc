= WeeChat Installation instructions
SÃ©bastien Helleu <flashcode@flashtux.org>


WeeChat can be built with cmake (recommended) or autotools.

[NOTE]
Only cmake is officially supported to build WeeChat. You should use autotools
only if you are not able to use cmake. +
Build with autotools requires more dependencies and is slower than with cmake.

== Dependencies

Following packages are *required*:

* cmake
* libncurses
* libcurl
* zlib
* libgcrypt

Following packages are all optional:

* for i18n: gettext
* for SSL: gnutls, ca-certificates
* for spell checking: aspell
* for scripting: python, perl, ruby, lua, tcl, guile
* for building doc: asciidoc, source-highlight
  (for man page: xsltproc, docbook-xml, docbook-xsl)

For a complete list of dependencies and versions recommended, please look at
'User's guide'.
