Only CMake is officially supported to build WeeChat. You should only use
autotools if you are not able to use CMake. +
Building with autotools requires more dependencies and is slower than with CMake.

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/directory
$ make
$ make install     (as root for installation in system directories)

https://weechat.org/files/doc/devel/weechat_user.en.html#compile_with_autotools[user's guide].
