                ||  boolean "or"
            - comparison operators:

                !=  not equal
                <=  less or equal
                <   less
                >=  greater or equal

                =*  is matching mask (wildcard "*" is allowed)
                !*  is NOT matching mask (wildcard "*" is allowed)

An expression is considered as "true" if it is not NULL, not empty, and different from "0".
The comparison is made using integers if the two expressions are valid integers.
To force a string comparison, add double quotes around each expression, for example:
  50 > 100      ==> 0
  "50" > "100"  ==> 1

Some variables are replaced in expression, using the format ${variable}, variable can be, by order of priority:
  1. an evaluated sub-string (format: "eval:xxx")
  2. a string with escaped chars (format: "esc:xxx" or "\xxx")
  3. a string with chars to hide (format: "hide:char,string")
  4. a string with max chars (format: "cut:max,suffix,string" or "cut:+max,suffix,string")
     or max chars displayed on screen (format: "cutscr:max,suffix,string" or "cutscr:+max,suffix,string")
  5. a color (format: "color:xxx", see "Plugin API reference", function "color")
  6. an info (format: "info:name,arguments", arguments are optional)
  7. current date/time (format: "date" or "date:format")
  8. an environment variable (format: "env:XXX")
  9. a ternary operator (format: "if:condition?value_if_true:value_if_false")
  10. an option (format: "file.section.option")
  11. a local variable in buffer
  12. a hdata name/variable (the value is automatically converted to string), by default "window" and "buffer" point to current window/buffer.
Format for hdata can be one of following:
  hdata.var1.var2...: start with a hdata (pointer must be known), and ask variables one after one (other hdata can be followed)
  hdata[list].var1.var2...: start with a hdata using a list, for example:
    ${buffer[gui_buffers].full_name}: full name of first buffer in linked list of buffers
    ${plugin[weechat_plugins].name}: name of first plugin in linked list of plugins
  hdata[pointer].var1.var2...: start with a hdata using a pointer, for example:
    ${buffer[0x1234abcd].full_name}: full name of the buffer with this pointer (can be used in triggers)
For name of hdata and variables, please look at "Plugin API reference", function "weechat_hdata_get".

Examples (simple strings):
  /eval -n ${info:version}                       ==> 0.4.3
  /eval -n ${env:HOME}                           ==> /home/user
  /eval -n ${weechat.look.scroll_amount}         ==> 3

  /eval -n ${window.buffer}                      ==> 0x2549320
  /eval -n ${window.buffer.full_name}            ==> core.weechat
  /eval -n ${window.buffer.number}               ==> 1
  /eval -n ${\t}                                 ==> <tab>
  /eval -n ${hide:-,${relay.network.password}}   ==> --------
  /eval -n ${cut:3,+,test}                       ==> tes+
  /eval -n ${cut:+3,+,test}                      ==> te+
  /eval -n ${date:%H:%M:%S}                      ==> 07:46:40
  /eval -n ${if:${info:term_width}>80?big:small} ==> big

Examples (conditions):
  /eval -n -c ${window.buffer.number} > 2 ==> 0
  /eval -n -c ${window.win_width} > 100   ==> 1
  /eval -n -c (8 > 12) || (5 > 2)         ==> 1

         - if tag starts with '!', then it is excluded and must NOT be in message
  regex: POSIX extended regular expression to search in line
         - use '\t' to separate prefix from message, special chars like '|' must be escaped: '\|'
         - if regex starts with '!', then matching result is reversed (use '\!' to start with '!')
         - two regular expressions are created: one for prefix and one for message
         - regex are case insensitive, they can start by "(?-i)" to become case sensitive

The default key alt+'=' toggles filtering on/off.

Tags most commonly used:
  no_filter, no_highlight, no_log, log0..log9 (log level),

When binding a command to a key, it is recommended to use key alt+k (or Esc then k), and then press the key to bind: this will insert key code in command line.

For context "mouse" (possible in context "cursor" too), key has format: "@area:key" or "@area1>area2:key" where area can be:
          *: any area on screen
       chat: chat area (any buffer)

   bar(xxx): bar "xxx"
    item(*): any bar item
  item(xxx): bar item "xxx"
Wildcard "*" is allowed in key to match many mouse events.
A special value for command with format "hsignal:name" can be used for context mouse, this will send the hsignal "name" with the focus hashtable as argument.
Another special value "-" can be used to disable key (it will be ignored when looking for keys).

Secured data with format ${sec.data.xxx} can be used in:
  - command /eval
  - command line argument "--run-command"

----

[[command_weechat_upgrade]]
* `+upgrade+`: upgrade WeeChat without disconnecting from servers

path_to_binary: path to WeeChat binary (default is current binary)
        -dummy: do nothing (option used to prevent accidental completion with "-quit")
         -quit: close *ALL* connections, save session and quit WeeChat, which makes possible a delayed restoration (see below)

This command upgrades and reloads a running WeeChat session. The new WeeChat binary must have been compiled or installed with a package manager before running this command.

Note: SSL connections are lost during upgrade, because reload of SSL sessions is currently not possible with GnuTLS. There is automatic reconnection after upgrade.

Upgrade process has 4 steps:
  1. save session into files for core and plugins (buffers, history, ..)
  2. unload all plugins (configuration files (*.conf) are written on disk)
  3. save WeeChat configuration (weechat.conf)
  4. execute new WeeChat binary and reload session.

With option "-quit", the process is slightly different:
  1. close *ALL* connections (irc, xfer, relay, ...)
  2. save session into files (*.upgrade)
  3. unload all plugins
  4. save WeeChat configuration
  5. quit WeeChat
Then later you can restore session with command: weechat --upgrade
IMPORTANT: you must restore the session with exactly same configuration (files *.conf).
It is possible to restore WeeChat session on another machine if you copy the content of directory "~/.weechat".

command: command to execute (or text to send to buffer if command does not start with '/')

Note: command is executed on buffer where /wait was executed (if buffer is not found (for example if it has been closed before execution of command), then command is executed on WeeChat core buffer).

Examples:
  join channel in 10 seconds:
    /wait 10 /join #test
  set away in 15 minutes:
    /wait 15m /away -all I'm away
