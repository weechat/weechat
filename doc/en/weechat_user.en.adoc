|===

The other options can be displayed with this command:

[source,shell]
----
cmake -LA
----

Or with Curses interface:

[source,shell]
----
ccmake ..
----

[[tests]]
==== Tests

Following packages are *required* to compile tests:

* libcpputest-dev
* C++ compiler

Tests must be enabled when compiling WeeChat:

[source,shell]
----
cmake .. -DENABLE_TESTS=ON
----

They can be launched after compilation from the build directory:

[source,shell]
----
ctest -V
----

[[git_sources]]
=== Git sources

Warning: Git sources are for advanced users: it may not compile or not be
stable. You're warned!

To get Git sources, issue this command:

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/weechat/weechat.git
----

Then follow instructions for source package (see
<<source_package,source package>>).

[[report_crashes]]
=== Report crashes

If you experienced crashes, or if you want to report any future WeeChat crash,
you have to:

* Compile with:
** debug info (or install binary package with debug info),
** address sanitizer (optional).
* Enable _core_ files on your system.
* Install gdb.

[[debug_build]]
==== Debug build

If you're compiling with CMake:

[source,shell]
----
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
----

[[address_sanitizer]]
==== Address sanitizer

You can additionally enable the address sanitizer, which causes WeeChat to
crash immediately in case of problem:

[source,shell]
----
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-fsanitize=address -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-fsanitize=address -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=-fsanitize=address
----

[CAUTION]
You should enable address sanitizer only if you're trying to cause a crash,
this is not recommended in production.

Then once compiled and installed, you must run WeeChat like this:

[source,shell]
----
ASAN_OPTIONS="detect_odr_violation=0 log_path=asan.log" weechat
----

In case of crash, the backtrace is in file `asan.log`.

[[core_files]]
==== Core files

To enable _core_ files, you can use option
<<option_weechat.startup.sys_rlimit,weechat.startup.sys_rlimit>>:

----
/set weechat.startup.sys_rlimit "core:-1"
----

For WeeChat ≤ 0.3.8 or if you want to enable core files even before WeeChat
starts, you can use `ulimit` command.

For example under Linux with _bash_ shell, add this line to your `~/.bashrc`:

[source,shell]
----
ulimit -c unlimited
----

Or max size:

[source,shell]
----
ulimit -c 200000
----

[[gdb_backtrace]]
==== Get backtrace with gdb

When WeeChat crashes, your system will create a file _core_ or _core.12345_
(_12345_ is process id) if the <<core_files,option is enabled>>.
This file is created in directory where you have run WeeChat (this is *not*
directory where WeeChat is installed!).

[NOTE]
On some systems like Archlinux, core dumps could be in another directory like
_/var/lib/systemd/coredump_ and you must use the command `coredumpctl` to read it. +
For more information, see this
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Core_dump[wiki page ^↗^^].

For example if _weechat_ is installed in _/usr/bin/_ and _core_ file is
in _/home/user/_, then run gdb with this command:

[source,shell]
----
gdb /usr/bin/weechat /home/user/core
----

Then under gdb, use command `bt full` to display backtrace.
You will see something like that:

----
(gdb) set logging file /tmp/crash.txt
(gdb) set logging on
Copying output to /tmp/crash.txt.
(gdb) bt full
#0  0x00007f9dfb04a465 in raise () from /lib/libc.so.6

        ptr_hook = 0x2811f40
        next_hook = 0x0
#6  0x000000000041b5b0 in gui_main_loop ()

        tv_timeout = {tv_sec = 0, tv_usec = 0}
        read_fds = {fds_bits = {0 <repeats 16 times>}}
        write_fds = {fds_bits = {0 <repeats 16 times>}}
        except_fds = {fds_bits = {0 <repeats 16 times>}}
        max_fd = <value optimized out>
----

You must report this trace to developers, and tell them what action caused this
crash.

Thank you for your help!

[[debug_running_weechat]]
==== Debug a running WeeChat

To debug a running WeeChat (for example if WeeChat seems blocked), you can use
gdb with process id (replace _12345_ with PID of weechat process):

[source,shell]
----
gdb /usr/bin/weechat 12345
----

Then like for a crash, use command `bt full`:

----
(gdb) bt full
----

[[running_weechat]]
== Running WeeChat

To start WeeChat, issue this command:

[source,shell]
----
weechat
----

When you run WeeChat for the first time, the default configuration files are
created in _~/.config/weechat_ with default options and values
(see <<files_and_directories,Files and directories>>).

[[command_line_options]]
=== Command line options

include::includes/cmdline_options.en.adoc[tag=standard]

Some extra options are available for debug purposes only:

[CAUTION]
Do *NOT* use any of these options in production!

include::includes/cmdline_options.en.adoc[tag=debug]

[[environment_variables]]
=== Environment variables

Some environment variables are used by WeeChat if they are defined:

[width="100%",cols="1m,6",options="header"]
|===
| Name                 | Description
| WEECHAT_HOME         | The WeeChat home (with configuration files, logs, scripts, etc.). Same behavior as <<compile_with_cmake,CMake option>> `WEECHAT_HOME`.
| WEECHAT_PASSPHRASE   | The passphrase used to decrypt secured data.
| WEECHAT_EXTRA_LIBDIR | An extra directory to load plugins (from the "plugins" directory in this path).
|===

[[colors_support]]
=== Colors support

WeeChat can use up to 32767 color pairs to display text in bars and chat area
(your terminal must support 256 colors to use them in WeeChat).

According to value of _TERM_ environment variable, you may have following limits
for colors in WeeChat:

[width="75%",cols="8,>3,>3",options="header"]
|===
| $TERM                                  | Colors | Pairs
| "rxvt-unicode", "xterm", ...           |     88 | 32767
| "rxvt-256color", "xterm-256color", ... |    256 | 32767
| "screen"                               |      8 |    64
| "screen-256color"                      |    256 | 32767
| "tmux"                                 |      8 |    64
| "tmux-256color"                        |    256 | 32767
|===

You can run `weechat --colors` or use command `/color` in WeeChat to
display limits for your environment.

Some recommended values for _TERM_ if you want 256 colors:

* under screen: _screen-256color_
* under tmux: _screen-256color_ or _tmux-256color_
* outside screen/tmux: _xterm-256color_, _rxvt-256color_, _putty-256color_, ...

[NOTE]
You may have to install package "ncurses-term" to use these values in _TERM_
variable.

If you are using screen, you can add this line to your _~/.screenrc_:

----
term screen-256color
----

If your _TERM_ variable has wrong value and that WeeChat is already running,
you can change it with these two commands:

----
/set env TERM screen-256color
/upgrade
----

[[files_and_directories]]
=== Files and directories

[[xdg_directories]]
==== XDG directories

WeeChat uses XDG directories by default (according to the
https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html[XDG Base Directory Specification ^↗^^]). +
A single home directory for all files can be forced by CMake option `WEECHAT_HOME`,
the environment variable `WEECHAT_HOME` or the command-line option `-d` / `--dir`.

When a single WeeChat home directory is not forced, XDG directories are used
and set like this:

[width="100%",cols="1,2m,5",options="header"]
|===
| Directory | Default value            | Fallback value if $XDG_XXX is not defined
| config    | $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/weechat | `$HOME/.config/weechat`
| data      | $XDG_DATA_HOME/weechat   | `$HOME/.local/share/weechat`
| cache     | $XDG_CACHE_HOME/weechat  | `$HOME/.cache/weechat`
| runtime   | $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/weechat | Same as _cache_ directory
|===

The configuration files are created with default values the first time you run WeeChat.

[[weechat_directories]]
==== WeeChat directories

The WeeChat directories are:

[width="100%",cols="1m,3",options="header"]
|===
| Path ^(1)^              | Description

|===

[IMPORTANT]
It is *not recommended* to edit configuration files by hand because WeeChat
may write them at any time (for example on <<command_weechat_quit,/quit>>)
and after any change you must run the command <<command_weechat_reload,/reload>>
(with the risk of losing other changes that were not yet saved with
<<command_weechat_save,/save>>). +
You can use the command <<command_weechat_set,/set>>, which checks the value
and applies immediately the changes.

[[upgrade]]
== Upgrade

If a new stable version of WeeChat is released, this is time for you to
switch to this version.

First of all, you must install the new version of WeeChat, either with your
package manager or by compiling yourself, so that the `weechat` binary and all
required files are in the same paths. +
This can be done while WeeChat is running.

[[upgrade_command]]
=== Upgrade command

WeeChat can restart the new binary, in place, using the
<<command_weechat_upgrade,/upgrade>> command: the buffer contents and non-TLS
connections are preserved. +
The TLS connections are lost during upgrade and are restored automatically
after the upgrade (reload of TLS sessions is currently not possible
with GnuTLS).

The command can also be used if you have to restart the machine, for example
to upgrade the kernel or to move your WeeChat to another machine:

----
/upgrade -quit
----

This saves the current state in `*.upgrade` files. You can then either reboot
or move the whole WeeChat directories (config, data, cache) to another machine,
and restart WeeChat later with this command:

[source,shell]
----
weechat --upgrade
----

[[restart_after_upgrade]]
=== Restart after upgrade

[[restart_upgrading_notes]]
==== Upgrading notes

After an upgrade, it is *strongly recommended* to read the file
https://github.com/weechat/weechat/blob/main/UPGRADING.md[UPGRADING.md ^↗^^]
which contains important information about breaking changes and some
manual actions that could be required.

You must read the versions between your old (excluded) and your new version (included). +
For example if you switch from version 4.0.0 to 4.3.0, you must read versions
4.0.1 to 4.3.0.

[[restart_configuration_upgrade]]
==== Configuration upgrade

WeeChat has an automatic upgrade of configuration files (`*.conf`):

* new options are silently added with default value
* obsolete options are automatically discarded and WeeChat displays a warning
  with the value read from file.

Example of warning when an option has been removed:

----
=!= Warning: /home/user/.config/weechat/sec.conf, line 15: unknown option for section "crypt": passphrase_file = ""
----

That means the option `sec.crypt.passphrase_file` has been removed, and you
had value set to empty string, which was the default value in the previous version
(in this case no manual action is required).

Each aspect of the layout can be customized with the appropriate <<command_line,command>>:
<<command_weechat_bar,`/bar`>> to customize the bars,
<<command_weechat_buffer,/buffer>> and <<command_weechat_window,`/window`>>
to customize <<buffers_and_windows,buffers and windows>>,
and <<command_weechat_layout,/layout>> to name, save and restore the screen layout
and the association between windows and buffers.

[[command_line]]
=== Command line

WeeChat command line (at the bottom of window) lets you execute commands or
send text to buffer.

[[command_line_syntax]]
==== Syntax

Commands begin with "/" char, followed by name of command. For example, to see
list of all options:

----
/set
----

Text sent to a buffer is any text that does not begin with "/" char.
For example, to send text _hello_ on current buffer:

----
hello
----

However, it is possible to start with "/" char, by adding another.
For example, to send text `/set` on current buffer:

----
//set
----

[[command_line_colors]]
==== Color codes

For some plugins like IRC, you can use color codes and attributes, as
follow (press kbd:[Ctrl+c] then following letter, with optional value):

[width="100%",cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Key                    | Description
| kbd:[Ctrl+c], kbd:[b]  | Bold text.
| kbd:[Ctrl+c], kbd:[c],
  kbd:[xx]               | Text color `xx` (see list of colors below).
| kbd:[Ctrl+c], kbd:[c],
  kbd:[xx], kbd:[,],
  kbd:[yy]               | Text color `xx` and background `yy` (see list of colors below).
| kbd:[Ctrl+c], kbd:[d],
  kbd:[xxxxxx]           | Text color `xxxxxx` (RGB as hexadecimal, for example `FF0000` for red).
| kbd:[Ctrl+c], kbd:[d],
  kbd:[xxxxxx], kbd:[,],
  kbd:[yyyyyy]           | Text color `xxxxxx` and background `yyyyyy` (RGB as hexadecimal).
| kbd:[Ctrl+c], kbd:[i]  | Italic text.
| kbd:[Ctrl+c], kbd:[o]  | Disable color and attributes.
| kbd:[Ctrl+c], kbd:[v]  | Reverse video (revert text color with background).
| kbd:[Ctrl+c], kbd:[_]  | Underlined text.
|===

[NOTE]
The same code (without number for kbd:[Ctrl+c], kbd:[c] and kbd:[Ctrl+c], kbd:[d])
can be used to stop the attribute.

Color codes for kbd:[Ctrl+c], kbd:[c] are:

include::{autogendir}/autogen_user_irc_colors.en.adoc[tag=irc_colors]

[NOTE]
To show all available colors in your terminal, you can do `/color` then
kbd:[Alt+c] in WeeChat or run this command in terminal: `weechat --colors`.

Example: display of "hello Alice!" with "hello" in light blue bold and
"Alice" in light red underlined:

----
^Cc12^Cbhello ^Cb^Cc04^C_Alice^C_^Cc!
----

Keys:

kbd:[Ctrl+c] kbd:[c] kbd:[1] kbd:[2] kbd:[Ctrl+c] kbd:[b] +
kbd:[h] kbd:[e] kbd:[l] kbd:[l] kbd:[o] kbd:[Space] +
kbd:[Ctrl+c] kbd:[b] kbd:[Ctrl+c] kbd:[c] kbd:[0] kbd:[4] kbd:[Ctrl+c] kbd:[pass:[_]] +
kbd:[A] kbd:[l] kbd:[i] kbd:[c] kbd:[e] +
kbd:[Ctrl+c] kbd:[pass:[_]] kbd:[Ctrl+c] kbd:[c] +
kbd:[!]

[NOTE]
In irc plugin, you can remap these colors using option
<<option_irc.color.mirc_remap,irc.color.mirc_remap>>.

[[buffers_and_windows]]
=== Buffers and windows

A _buffer_ is composed by a number, a name, lines displayed (and some other
data).

Examples of buffers:

* core buffer (created by WeeChat on startup, cannot be closed)
* irc server (displays messages from server)
* irc channel
* irc private messages

A _window_ is a screen area which displays a buffer. It is possible to split
your screen into many windows (examples <<window_split_examples,below>>,
see the <<command_weechat_window,/window>> command for details).

Each window displays one buffer. A buffer can be hidden (not displayed by a
window) or displayed by one or more windows.

Screen layouts and the association between windows and buffers can be
<<command_weechat_layout,saved and restored>>.

[[window_split_examples]]
==== Examples

Example of horizontal split (`/window splith`):

....

[[bare_display]]
==== Bare display

A special display, called "bare display" can be used for easy click on long URLs
and selection of text (using the mouse).

The bare display has following features:

* It displays only the content of current buffer: no window split neither bars
  (no title, nicklist, status, input, ...).
* The WeeChat mouse support is disabled (if it was enabled): you can use your
  mouse like you do in the terminal to click on URLs and select text.
* Ncurses is not used, therefore URLs are not cut at the end of lines.

The default key to enable bare display is kbd:[Alt+l] (`L`), and same key to exit
(or by default anything changing the input will exit the bare display, see option
<<option_weechat.look.bare_display_exit_on_input,weechat.look.bare_display_exit_on_input>>).

The time format can be customized with the option
<<option_weechat.look.bare_display_time_format,weechat.look.bare_display_time_format>>.

The bare display can be enabled for a specific delay using the command
<<command_weechat_window,/window>>.

If WeeChat looks like that:

[[buffers]]
=== Buffers

[[lines_format]]
==== Format of lines

Lines displayed in formatted buffers have following fields:

[width="100%",cols="2,2,10",options="header"]
|===
| Field               | Displayed          | Description
| date/time (message) | Yes                | Date/time of message (may be past).
| date/time (print)   | No                 | Date/time when WeeChat prints the message.
| prefix              | Yes                | Prefix of message, commonly a nick.
| message             | Yes                | The message itself.
| displayed           | No                 | Boolean: true if line is displayed, false if line is filtered with command <<command_weechat_filter,/filter>>.
| highlight           | No                 | Boolean: true if line has a highlight, false otherwise.
| tags                | With `/debug tags` | Tags associated with the line (see <<lines_tags,lines tags>>).
|===

The display of lines can be customized with many look options
(_pass:[weechat.look.*]_) and color options (_pass:[weechat.color.chat_*]_).

[[lines_tags]]
==== Lines tags

WeeChat uses tags in lines for different purposes:

* highlight
* notify level
* logging
* use of command <<command_weechat_filter,/filter>>

Tags can be displayed with the command `/debug tags` (same command to hide them).

Tags commonly used (non-exhaustive list):

[width="100%",cols="1m,4",options="header"]
|===
| Tag              | Description
| no_filter        | Line cannot be filtered.
| no_highlight     | No highlight is possible on line.
| no_log           | Line is not written in log file.
| log0 … log9      | Level of log for line (see the <<command_logger_logger,/logger>> command).
| notify_none      | The line must not be added to hotlist. ^(1)^
| notify_message   | The line is a user message. ^(1)^
| notify_private   | The line is a private message. ^(1)^
| notify_highlight | The line is a message with highlight. ^(1)^
| self_msg         | Self message.
| nick_xxx         | Message is from nick "xxx".
| prefix_nick_ccc  | Prefix is a nick with color "ccc".
| host_xxx         | Username and host in message.
| irc_xxx          | IRC message "xxx" (can be a command or a 3-digits number).
| irc_numeric      | IRC numeric message.
| irc_error        | Error from IRC server.
| irc_action       | Action from a nick (command `/me`).
| irc_ctcp         | CTCP message.
| irc_ctcp_reply   | Reply to CTCP message.
| irc_smart_filter | IRC message that can be filtered with the "smart filter".
| away_info        | Message with away info.
|===

[NOTE]
^(1)^ When no tag "notify_xxx" is present, the default level is "low". If a tag
"notify_xxx" is present, the real notify level can be different, for example
if a max hotlist level is used for a nick, the notify level can be lower than
the value in the tag.

[[local_variables]]
==== Local variables

Local variables can be defined in all buffers.

A local variable has:

* a name (string)
* a value (string, can be empty).

Local variables can be set by WeeChat, plugins, scripts, or manually on the
command line in the buffer.

For example to add the local variable "completion_default_template":

----
/buffer setvar completion_default_template %(my_completion)
----

To list local variables in the current buffer:

----
/buffer listvar
----

To remove the local variable "completion_default_template":

----
/buffer delvar completion_default_template
----

By default WeeChat and its default plugins interpret these variables:

[width="100%",cols="2m,2,5",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Value | Description

| away
| any string
| Away message on the server, set by irc plugin.

| channel
| any string
| Channel name, set by irc/xfer plugins and debug buffer of relay/trigger plugins.

| charset_modifier
| any string
| Charset modifier for the server buffer, set by irc plugin.

| completion_default_template
| any string
| Default completion template for the buffer, overriding the option
  `weechat.completion.default_template`.

| filter
| any string
| Filter defined on some buffers like `/fset`, `/list` (irc), `/server raw` (irc)
  and `/script`.

| host
| any string
| Self host (if known), set by irc plugin.

| lag
| any string
| Lag on the server, set by irc plugin.

| name
| any string
| Buffer name (be careful, this is not the full name and this name is not
  enough to identify or search a buffer).

| nick
| any string
| Self nick, set by irc and xfer plugins.

| no_log
| `1` (or any non-empty string)
| If set, the logger plugin does not log anything for the buffer.

| plugin

| Close callback defined by a script for a buffer.

| script_close_cb_data
| any string
| Data for close callback defined by a script for a buffer.

| script_input_cb

| Input callback defined by a script for a buffer.

| script_input_cb_data
| any string
| Data for input callback defined by a script for a buffer.

| script_name
| any string
| Name of the script which created the buffer.

| server
| any string
| Server name, set by irc plugin and debug buffer of relay/trigger plugins.

| spell_suggest
| any string
| Misspelled word and suggestions (format: "misspelled:suggestions"), set by
  spell plugin.

| trigger_filter
| any string
| Trigger filter, set by trigger plugin.

| type
| any string, for example:
  `channel`,
  `debug`,
  `exec`,
  `option`,
  `private`,
  `relay`,
  `script`,
  `server`,
  `user`,
  `xfer`
| Type of buffer, set by WeeChat and many plugins.

|===

[NOTE]
External plugins and scripts can define and use other local variables.

[[buflist]]
=== List of buffers

Buflist plugin displays a list of buffers in a bar item called "buflist"
(four other bar items "buflist2", "buflist3", "buflist4" and "buflist5" are
available as well). +
A default bar "buflist" is created on startup with this item.

[[buflist_commands]]

[[cursor_mode]]
=== Cursor mode

The cursor mode allows you to move freely the cursor anywhere on screen, in chat
area and bars, and lets you perform actions at the given position. +
You can enter in cursor mode either with the command `/cursor` or with a mouse
middle click (mouse must have been enabled with key kbd:[Alt+m] or command
`/mouse enable`).

Typical use is to quote messages (chat area) or interact with nicks (nicklist bar).

See command <<command_weechat_cursor,/cursor>> and
<<key_bindings_cursor_context,key bindings in cursor context>> for the list
of actions you can perform in this mode.

[[key_bindings]]
== Key bindings

WeeChat provides a lot of default key bindings, listed in the following chapters. +
They can be changed and new ones can be added with the <<command_weechat_key,/key>> command.

|===
| Name         | Color
| default      | Default terminal color (transparent for background)

| white        | White
|===

[[colors_extended]]
==== Extended colors

WeeChat dynamically allocates color pairs when colors are used on screen (to
display buffers and bars).

In addition to basic colors, you can use a color number between 1 and the limit
of your terminal.

Use command `/color` to see current colors and limits. With kbd:[Alt+c] you can
temporarily switch to terminal colors to choose a color.

For example if you want to display time in orange in buffer, do:

----
/set weechat.color.chat_time 214
----

Or if you want a very dark green background for status bar:

----
/set weechat.bar.status.color_bg 22
----

[[colors_aliases]]
==== Aliases

You can add color aliases with command `/color alias` and then use this alias
in any color option.

For example:

----
/color alias 214 orange
/set weechat.color.chat_delimiters orange
----

[[colors_attributes]]
==== Attributes

It is possible to use some attributes for colors. One or more attributes can be
added before color name or number:

* `+%+`: blink
* `+.+`: "dim" (half bright)
* `+*+`: bold text
* `+!+`: reverse video
* `+/+`: italic
* `+_+`: underlined text
* `+|+`: keep attributes: do not reset blink/dim/bold/reverse/italic/underlined
  when changing color

For example if you want self nick as white underlined, do:

----
/set weechat.color.chat_nick_self _white
----

Or if you want time in status bar as orange underlined with bold:

----
/set weechat.color.status_time *_214
----

To use an attribute with default terminal color (-1), you must use a number
greater than last terminal color, for example max color in WeeChat: 99999.

Example of bold with terminal foreground color:

----
/set weechat.color.status_time *99999
----

[[charset]]
=== Charset

Charset plugin lets you decode or encode data using charsets.

There is default charset for decode/encode, and specific charsets for buffers
(or group of buffers).

This plugin is optional, but recommended: if it's not loaded, WeeChat
can only read/write UTF-8 data.

Charset plugin should be autoloaded by WeeChat. To be sure plugin is loaded,
try:

----
/charset
----

If command is not found, then load plugin with command:

----
/plugin load charset
----

If plugin is not found, then you should compile again WeeChat with
plugins and Charset support.

When Charset plugin starts, it displays terminal and internal charsets.
Terminal charset depends on your locale, and internal is UTF-8.

For example:

....
charset: terminal: ISO-8859-15, internal: UTF-8
....

[[charset_set]]
==== Set charset

To set global decode and encode charsets, use command `/set`.

For example:

----
/set charset.default.decode ISO-8859-15
/set charset.default.encode ISO-8859-15
----

If global decode charset is not set (for example during first
load of Charset plugin), it will be automatically set to terminal
charset (if it's different from UTF-8), or by default to _ISO-8859-1_.

Default encode value is empty, so it sends by default with
internal charset (UTF-8).

To set IRC server charset, use command `/charset` on server buffer.
If you give only charset, then it will set decoding and encoding values.

For example:

----
/charset ISO-8859-15
----

It's equivalent to:

----
/charset decode ISO-8859-15
/charset encode ISO-8859-15
----

To set IRC channel (or private) charset, use same commands as server,
but on channel (or private) buffer.

To set charset for all channels/privates of an IRC server:

----
/set charset.encode.irc.libera ISO-8859-15
----

To see all charsets used, use following command:

----
/set charset.*
----

[[notify_levels]]
=== Notify levels

[[setup_notify_levels]]
==== Setup notify levels

Four levels are possible in messages displayed in buffers, from lower to higher:

* _low_: message with low importance (for example irc join/part/quit)
* _message_: message from a user
* _private_: message in a private buffer
* _highlight_: message with highlight

Each buffer has a notify level, which is used to decide what messages will add
buffer in hotlist.

The default notify level can be set using option
<<option_weechat.look.buffer_notify_default,weechat.look.buffer_notify_default>>,
default is _all_.

[width="75%",cols="2m,7",options="header"]
|===
| Notify level | Level of messages added to hotlist
| none         | (none)
| highlight    | highlight + private
| message      | highlight + private + message
| all          | highlight + private + message + low
|===

Notify level can be defined for a set of buffers, for example all buffers of
irc server "libera":

----
/set weechat.notify.irc.libera message
----

Set notify level _highlight_ on channel "#weechat" only:

----
/set weechat.notify.irc.libera.#weechat highlight
----

The notify level for a buffer can be set with command `/buffer`:

----
/buffer notify highlight
----

[[max_hotlist_level_nicks]]
==== Max hotlist level for nicks

It is possible to set max hotlist level for some nicks, per buffer, or per group
of buffers (like IRC servers).

The buffer property "hotlist_max_level_nicks" can be set with a list of nicks
and for each nick the max hotlist level to trigger, possible levels are:

* -1: no hotlist changes for nick
* 0: low priority (like join/part messages)
* 1: message
* 2: private message
* 3: highlight (in fact useless, since it's already the default max for all messages)

For example to disable highlights from "joe" and "mike" on current buffer:

----
/buffer setauto hotlist_max_level_nicks_add joe:2,mike:2
----

[[highlights]]
=== Highlights

[[highlights_disable]]
==== Disable highlights

You can disable highlights with option
<<option_weechat.look.highlight_disable_regex,weechat.look.highlight_disable_regex>>
(regular expression). +
When a highlight is disabled with this option, the other highlight options are
ignored.

For example to disable any highlight on messages with a word beginning
with "flash" between chevrons:

----
/set weechat.look.highlight_disable_regex "<flash.*>"
----

This can also be set with the buffer property "highlight_disable_regex".

Same example, specific to the current buffer:

----
/buffer setauto highlight_disable_regex <flash.*>
----

[[highlights_words]]
==== Add words to highlight

By default, WeeChat highlights messages from other users containing your nick,
therefore the highlight depends on the buffer (the nick can be different from
one buffer to another).

You can add other words to highlight with the option
<<option_weechat.look.highlight,weechat.look.highlight>>, for example to
highlight your nick and "word1", "word2" and all words beginning with "test":

----
/set weechat.look.highlight "word1,word2,test*"
----

If you need a more specific rule for the word, you can use regular expressions
with the option <<option_weechat.look.highlight_regex,weechat.look.highlight_regex>>,
for example to highlight words "flashcode", "flashcöde" and "flashy":

----
/set weechat.look.highlight_regex "flashc[oö]de|flashy"
----

The delimiters around words to highlight can be customized with the option
<<option_weechat.look.word_chars_highlight,weechat.look.word_chars_highlight>>.

[[highlights_tags]]
==== Add tags to highlight

Lines displayed can contain "tags", which give some info about the origin of
message or the message itself. +
You can display tags with the command `/debug tags` (same command to hide them).

You can add specific tags to highlight with the option
<<option_weechat.look.highlight_tags,weechat.look.highlight_tags>>.
Tags are separated by commas, and multiple tags can be separated by `+++` to do
a logical "and" between them.

For example to highlight all messages from nick "FlashCode" and all notices
from nicks beginning with "toto":

----
/set weechat.look.highlight_tags "nick_flashcode,irc_notice+nick_toto*"
----

[[highlights_regex_buffer]]
==== Set extra highlights on buffer

You can force highlight using a regular expression with the buffer property
"highlight_regex".

For example to force the highlight on all messages in the current buffer:

----
/buffer setauto highlight_regex .*
----

[[buffer_logging]]
=== Buffer logging

The Logger plugin lets you save content of buffers to files, with options
about what and how it is saved.

[[logger_log_levels]]
==== Log levels

Logging is made with a level for each buffer. Default level is 9 (log
all messages displayed on buffer).
You can change level for one buffer, or a group of buffers.

Possible levels are 0 to 9. Zero means "do not log anything" and 9 means
"log all messages".

Plugins are using different levels for messages displayed.
IRC plugin uses following levels:

* level 1: message from user (on channel or private)
* level 2: nick change (you or someone else)
* level 3: any server message (except join/part/quit)
* level 4: server message join/part/quit

So if you set level 3 for an IRC channel, WeeChat will log all messages,
but not join/part/quit.

Some examples:

* Set level 3 for IRC channel #weechat:

----
/set logger.level.irc.libera.#weechat 3
----

* Set level 3 for libera server buffer:

----
/set logger.level.irc.server.libera 3
----

* Set level 3 for all channels on server libera:

----
/set logger.level.irc.libera 3
----

* Set level 2 for all IRC buffers:

----
/set logger.level.irc 2
----

[[logger_filenames_masks]]
==== Filenames masks

It is possible to define a filename mask for each buffer, and use local buffer
variables to build filename. To see available local variables for current buffer:

----
/buffer listvar
----

Masks will be matched on options in descending order of specificity on
`logger.mask.$plugin.*`, with `logger.file.mask` as fallback option.

For example, on buffer "irc.libera.#weechat", WeeChat will search a mask with
option name, in this order:

----
logger.mask.irc.libera.#weechat
logger.mask.irc.libera
logger.mask.irc
logger.file.mask
----

That means you can have masks specific for some IRC servers
("logger.mask.irc.libera") or for a plugin ("logger.mask.irc").

[[logger_files_by_date]]
===== Log files by date

To have log files by date, you can use date/time specifiers in mask (see
`man strftime` for formats), for example:

----
/set logger.file.mask "%Y/%m/$plugin.$name.weechatlog"
----

You'll have following files:

....
~/.local/share/weechat

    ...
....

[[logger_irc_files_by_server_channel]]
===== IRC log files by server and channel

If you want one directory by IRC server and one file by channel inside:

----
/set logger.mask.irc "irc/$server/$channel.weechatlog"
----

You'll have following files:

....
~/.local/share/weechat
└── logs
    └── irc
        ├── libera
        │   ├── libera.weechatlog
        │   ├── #weechat.weechatlog

        │   └── #channel2.weechatlog
        ...
....

[[logger_rotation_compression]]
==== Rotation and compression

It is possible to define a max size for log files, and when it is reached,
there is automatic rotation of log file.

The rotated log files can be compressed with gzip or
https://facebook.github.io/zstd/[zstd ^↗^^].

[NOTE]
As the compression of a file can take some time, it is performed in background.

Example with a max size of 2GB and compression with gzip, using good compression
level (slower than default one):

----
/set logger.file.rotation_compression_type gzip
/set logger.file.rotation_compression_level 80
/set logger.file.rotation_size_max "2g"
----

If you want to use a decimal number, you can use the unit below and multiply
by 1000, for example to set max size to 2.5GB:

----
/set logger.file.rotation_size_max "2500m"
----

With these settings, you'll end with files like these ones (in this example
there is rotation only for the log of #weechat channel):

....
~/.local/share/weechat
└── logs
    ├── core.weechat.weechatlog

[[mouse]]
=== Mouse support

WeeChat supports mouse clicks and gestures. It is working with local terminal,
and remotely via ssh connection with or without screen/tmux.

[[mouse_enable]]
==== Enable mouse

To enable mouse at startup:

----
/set weechat.look.mouse on
----

To enable mouse now, press kbd:[Alt+m] or do following command:

----
/mouse enable
----

It is possible to temporarily disable mouse, and bind that on a key. For example
key kbd:[Alt+%] to disable mouse for 10 seconds:

----
/key bind meta-% /mouse toggle 10
----

[IMPORTANT]
When mouse is enabled in WeeChat, all mouse events are caught by WeeChat, so
actions such as copy/paste or clicks on URLs are not sent to the terminal. +
Using kbd:[Shift] key causes the events to be sent directly to the terminal,
as if the mouse was disabled (on some terminals like iTerm, you have to use
kbd:[Alt] instead of kbd:[Shift]).

[NOTE]
For any problem with mouse, please look at
link:weechat_faq.en.html#mouse[WeeChat FAQ / Mouse ^↗^^].

[[mouse_bind_events]]
==== Bind mouse events to commands

Many default mouse events are already defined by WeeChat (see
<<key_bindings_mouse,mouse actions>>).

You can change or add bindings with the command `/key` using context "mouse"
(for syntax, see command <<command_weechat_key,/key>>).

Event name consists of a modifier (optional), a button/wheel name and a gesture
(optional). Different elements are separated by `+-+`.

List of modifiers (by order in the event name):

| ctrl     | Key kbd:[Ctrl]
| shift    | Key kbd:[Shift] ^(1)^
|===

[NOTE]
^(1)^ The `shift` modifier can rarely be used in WeeChat because many terminals
use this modifier to catch directly mouse events.

Several modifiers can be combined, for example:

* `alt-ctrl`
* `ctrl-shift`
* `alt-ctrl-shift`

List of incomplete events (only for buttons, useful for plugins/scripts):

[width="100%",cols="1m,4",options="header"]
|===
| Event      | Description
| event-down | Button was pressed but not released yet
| event-drag | Mouse was moved with button pressed down
|===

Example of events:

* `button1`
* `ctrl-button1`
* `button1-gesture-right`
* `button1-event-down`
* `button1-event-drag`
* `alt-button2-gesture-down-long`
* `wheelup`
* `alt-ctrl-wheeldown`
* ...

[TIP]
When binding a key in context "mouse", it's possible to match many events using
`+*+` at beginning or end of name, for example `+button1-gesture-*+` will match
any gesture made using left button.

[TIP]
You can find an event name with command `+/input grab_mouse+` then doing event
with mouse. This will insert event name on command line.

[[spell_checking]]
=== Spell checking

Spell plugin lets you check spelling in command line. It is possible to use
many languages by buffer.

Spell checking is disabled by default and can be toggled with key kbd:[Alt+s].

[[spell_dictionaries]]
==== Dictionaries

Before using spell checking, dictionaries must be defined, either globally or
specific to buffers.

Multiple dictionaries can be used at same time: WeeChat will check words in all
dictionaries.

For example to use English and French:

----
/set spell.check.default_dict "en,fr"
----

It is possible to use a different dictionary on a specific buffer, for example
on a German channel:

----
/spell setdict de
----

You can also specify a dictionary for a group of buffers, for example English
for all channels on libera IRC server:

----
/set spell.dict.irc.libera en
----

For more information, see the command <<command_spell_spell,/spell>>.

[[spell_speller_options]]
==== Speller options

Speller options can be defined by adding options in section "option" of aspell
configuration.

The option name is an aspell configuration option. List of options can be found
in a shell with following command:

[source,shell]
----
aspell config
----

For example, to enable option "ignore-case":

----
/set spell.option.ignore-case "true"
----

[[spell_suggestions]]
==== Suggestions

Suggestions are displayed in a bar item called "spell_suggest". The number of
suggestions is set in option _spell.check.suggestions_.

To enable suggestions you must set option _spell.check.suggestions_ to an
integer ≥ 0 and add the bar item "spell_suggest" to a bar, like _status_.

Example of suggestions with English dictionary (`en`):

....

[[bars]]
=== Bars

A _bar_ is an area beside the chat that can contain any type of text.

The bar options can be set with options `weechat.bar.name.option` where `name`
is the name of the bar and `option` the option for this bar.

List of bar options:

[width="100%",cols="2m,2,10",options="header"]
|===
| Option | Values | Description

| type | `root`, `window`
| A bar with type `root` is displayed exactly one time on screen, outside all
  windows. The default bar _buflist_ has type `root`. +
  A bar with type `window` is displayed in each window, for example if you
  split one time the screen (with `/window splith` or `/window splitv`), you
  will have one bar in each window. The default bars _title_, _status_,
  _input_ and _nicklist_ have type `window`.

| position | `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`
| Position of the bar: above/below chat, on the left/right.

| priority | integer ≥ 0
| Priority for display of bar: this is used for ordering the bars on screen when
  many bars have same type and position. +
  The bars are displayed from the edge of the screen to the center. A higher
  priority will display bar at the beginning, so closer to the edge. +
  Example: _input_ bar has priority 1000, so it is displayed before the _status_
  bar, which has priority 500.

| size | integer ≥ 0
| The size of the bar: number of columns for position left/right, number
  of lines for position top/bottom. A size of `0` means automatic, so the size
  will be computed according to content displayed in bar.

| size_max | integer ≥ 0
| The maximum size for a bar, `0` = no limit (this option is used only if
  `size` = `0`).

| color_bg | color
| The default background color for the bar.

| color_fg | color
| The default text color for the bar.

| color_delim | color
| The color for delimiters in bar.

| hidden | `on`, `off`
| When option is `on`, the bar is hidden. +
  Note: instead of changing this option, the command `/bar` is preferred, for
  example: `/bar toggle nicklist` (see command <<command_weechat_bar,/bar>>).

| separator | `on`, `off`
| When option is `on`, a separator (line) is displayed between this bar and
  other bars (or chat).

| items | string
| A list of _items_ (see <<bar_items,items>> for more info).

| filling_left_right | `+horizontal+`, `+vertical+`, `+columns_horizontal+`, `+columns_vertical+`
| Type of filling for a bar which has position `left` or `right` (see
  <<bar_filling,filling>> for more info).

| filling_top_bottom | `+horizontal+`, `+vertical+`, `+columns_horizontal+`, `+columns_vertical+`
| Type of filling for a bar which has position `top` or `bottom` (see
  <<bar_filling,filling>> for more info).

| conditions | string
| The conditions to display the bar (see <<bar_conditions,conditions>> for more
  info).
|===

[[bar_items]]
==== Items

The option _items_ is a string with a list of bar items, separated by a comma
(space between items on screen) or `+++` (glued items).

The list of bar items is displayed with command `/bar listitems`.

Before or after item name, you can use chars (that are not alphanumeric, `+-+`
or `+_+`). They will be displayed before/after item with the delimiters color
defined in bar (option _color_delim_).

Example of bar with items
"[time],buffer_number+:+buffer_plugin+.+buffer_name,[buffer_last_number]":

....
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│[12:55] 3:irc/libera.#weechat [9]                                          │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
....

[[item_spacer]]
===== Spacer item

An item called `spacer` can be used to align items (left, center, right).

When at least one `spacer` item is used in a bar, the whole bar width is used:
the spacers auto expand with the same size (or almost). +
When the bar is not large enough for all items, spacers are not displayed.

[NOTE]
The `spacer` bar item can be used only in bars with position `top` or `bottom`,
filling `horizontal` and size `1`.

Example of bar with items
"[time],spacer,buffer_number+:+buffer_plugin+.+buffer_name,spacer,[buffer_last_number]":

....
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│[12:55]                      3:irc/libera.#weechat                      [9]│
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
....

[[item_force_buffer]]
===== Force buffer

A special syntax can be used to force the buffer used when displaying the bar
item: "@buffer:item" (where "buffer" is the full name of buffer and "item" is
the name of a bar item).

This is useful in root bars, to display item for a specific buffer which is
not displayed in the current window (or even not displayed at all).

Example: nicklist of bitlbee in a root bar (if the bar is called
_bitlist_ and if bitlbee server is called _bitlbee_):

----
/set weechat.bar.bitlist.items "@irc.bitlbee.&bitlbee:buffer_nicklist"
----

[[custom_bar_items]]
===== Custom bar items

Custom bar items can be added with the <<command_weechat_item,/item>> command,
each new item having two properties defined via configuration options:

* `conditions`: evaluated conditions to display the bar item, for example to
  restrict the bar item to some specific buffers (if empty, the bar item is
  displayed everywhere)
* `content`: evaluated content of bar item.

In both options, the following variables can be used:

* `window`: pointer to the window where the bar is displayed (`NULL` for root bars)
* `buffer`: pointer to buffer where the bar is displayed (current buffer for root bars).

Examples of conditions:

[width="100%",cols="3,10",options="header"]
|===
| Condition | Description
| `${window}` | Displayed in window bars only
| `${buffer.number} == 1` | Displayed in all buffers with number = 1
| `${buffer.plugin.name} == irc` | Displayed in all IRC buffers
| `${type} == channel` | Displayed in all buffers where local variable `type` is set to `channel` (example: all IRC channels)
| `${type} == private` | Displayed in all buffers where local variable `type` is set to `private` (example: all IRC private buffers)
|===

[NOTE]
There's no builtin way to refresh the custom bar items. You can use the
<<trigger,Trigger>> plugin to force the refresh, for example via one or more
signals received.

For more information and examples, see the <<command_weechat_item,/item>> command.

[[bar_filling]]
==== Filling

There are four types of filling:

* `+horizontal+`: the items are displayed horizontally, from left to right. If
  there are new lines in items, a space is used to separate lines.
* `+vertical+`: the items are displayed from top to bottom. If there are new
  lines in items, a new line is used to separate lines.
* `+columns_horizontal+`: items are displayed using columns, where text is
  aligned on the left. The first item is on top left, the second is on same
  line, on the right.
* `+columns_vertical+`: items are displayed using columns, where text is aligned
  on the left. The first item is on top left, the second is one line below.

Default bars _title_, _status_ and _input_ have _horizontal_ filling, and
default bar _nicklist_ has _vertical_ filling.

Some examples of filling for bar _nicklist_:

[[bar_conditions]]
==== Conditions

The option _conditions_ is a string which is evaluated to know if the bar
must be displayed or not.

The string can be:

* _active_: the window must be active
* _inactive_: the window must be inactive
* _nicklist_: the buffer displayed in window must have a nicklist
* an expression: it is evaluated as boolean (see command
  <<command_weechat_eval,/eval>>)

For the expression, following variables are available:

* `+${active}+`: true if window is active
* `+${inactive}+`: true if window is inactive
* `+${nicklist}+`: true if buffer displayed in window has a nicklist

Following pointers are available:

* `+${window}+`: the window where condition is evaluated
* `+${buffer}+`: the buffer of window where condition is evaluated

Example to display nicklist bar in all buffers with a nicklist, and only if
width of terminal is > 100:

----
/set weechat.bar.nicklist.conditions "${nicklist} && ${info:term_width} > 100"
----

Same condition, but always display nicklist on buffer _&bitlbee_
(even if terminal is small):

----
/set weechat.bar.nicklist.conditions "${nicklist} && (${info:term_width} > 100 || ${buffer.full_name} == irc.bitlbee.&bitlbee)"
----

[[secured_data]]
=== Secured data

[[secured_data_storage]]
==== Storage

WeeChat can encrypt passwords or private data using secured data, stored in file
_sec.conf_.

This configuration file is read before any other file, and the values stored
inside can be used in various WeeChat or plugins/scripts options.

You can set a passphrase to encrypt data in _sec.conf_. This is not mandatory
but highly recommended, otherwise data is stored as plain text in file.

----
/secure passphrase this is my passphrase
----

[[secured_data_passphrase_on_startup]]
===== Passphrase on startup

When a passphrase is set, WeeChat will ask you to enter it on startup
(but not on `/upgrade`).

If you are using a password manager, you can run an external program to read
the passphrase instead of having to type it manually on WeeChat startup. +
For example with password-store (command `pass`):

----
/set sec.crypt.passphrase_command "/usr/bin/pass show weechat/passphrase"
----

The program may ask you unlock your GPG key or enter another passphrase to
read the secret. WeeChat will wait for the end of the command to read the
passphrase on the standard output (it must be on the first line without any
extra character). +
If the output contains no passphrase or if it is wrong, WeeChat will then ask
you to enter it.

[[secured_data_encryption]]
===== Encryption

The encryption of data is made in 3 steps:

. Derive a key from the passphrase (with optional salt).
. Compute hash of data to encrypt.
. Encrypt the hash + data (output is: salt + encrypted hash/data).

[NOTE]
The cipher block mode is _CFB_.

The result is put as hexadecimal string in file _sec.conf_, for example:

----
[data]
__passphrase__ = on
libera = "53B1C86FCDA28FC122A95B0456ABD79B5AB74654F21C3D099A6CCA8173239EEA59533A1D83011251F96778AC3F5166A394"
----

[[secured_data_decryption]]
===== Decryption

The decryption of data is made in 3 steps:

. Derive a key using salt and passphrase.
. Decrypt hash + data.
. Check that decrypted hash == hash of data.

[[secured_data_manage]]
==== Manage secured data

To add secured data, use `/secure set`, for example a password for _libera_
IRC server:

----
/secure set libera mypassword
----

For comfort, secured data can be displayed in a dedicated buffer (kbd:[Alt+v] on
buffer to see values), just do:

----
/secure
----

Secured data can be used in some options that can contain private data like
password, using this format: "${sec.data.xxx}" where "xxx" is the name of
secured data (used with `/secure set xxx ...`). +
For a complete list of supported options, see the <<command_weechat_secure,/secure>> command.

To use the _libera_ password, for example with
<<irc_sasl_authentication,SASL authentication>>:

----
/set irc.server.libera.sasl_password "${sec.data.libera}"
----

[[command_aliases]]
=== Command aliases

Alias plugin lets you create alias for commands (from WeeChat or other
plugins).

Some aliases are created by default, with name in upper case (to make them
different from standard commands); commands are not case-sensitive in WeeChat,
so for example `/close` runs the alias `/CLOSE`.

List of default aliases:

[[irc]]
== IRC

The IRC plugin is designed to chat through IRC protocol with other people.

It is multi-servers, and offers all supported IRC commands including DCC chat
and file transfer (via xfer plugin, see <<xfer,Xfer plugin>>).

[[irc_command_line_options]]
=== Command line options

It is possible to give URL for one or many IRC servers, as follow:

----
irc[6][s]://[nick[:password]@]irc.example.org[:port][/channel][,channel[...]]
----

Example to join _#weechat_ and _#weechat-fr_ on server _irc.libera.chat_ server,
default port (6667), with nick _alice_:

[source,shell]
----
weechat irc://alice@irc.libera.chat/#weechat,#weechat-fr
----

[[irc_servers]]
=== Servers

[[irc_servers_add]]
==== Add a server

By default no servers are defined. You can add as many servers as you want with
the <<command_irc_server,/server>> command.

For example to connect to https://libera.chat/[libera.chat ^↗^^]:

----
/server add libera irc.libera.chat
----

[NOTE]
Default port is 6697 and TLS (encrypted traffic) is enabled.

You can tell WeeChat to auto-connect to this server on startup:

----
/set irc.server.libera.autoconnect on
----

To authenticate, it is recommended to use SASL (if supported on the server),
with the password stored as secured data (see also chapter on
<<irc_sasl_authentication,SASL authentication>>):

----
/set irc.server.libera.sasl_username "alice"
/secure set libera xxxxxxx
/set irc.server.libera.sasl_password "${sec.data.libera}"
----

If SASL is not supported, you can use a command to send a message to nickserv:

----
/set irc.server.libera.command "/msg nickserv identify ${sec.data.libera}"
----

[NOTE]
By sending a message to nickserv, you may authenticate after joining channels
which could be a problem on some channels requiring you to be authenticated
to join. In this case, you can set a command delay:
`/set irc.server.libera.command_delay 5`.

[[irc_servers_options]]
==== Server options

Server options are named `irc.server.<server>.<option>` where `<server>` is the
internal name of the server and `<option>` the name of an option. +
The value of a server option is inherited from `irc.server_default.xxx`
if the server option has the special value `null`.

For example if you created the _libera_ server with the commands above, you'll
see this with the command `/fset libera`:

....
irc.server.libera.addresses             string   "irc.libera.chat"
irc.server.libera.anti_flood            integer  null -> 2000
irc.server.libera.autoconnect           boolean  on
irc.server.libera.autojoin              string   null -> ""
irc.server.libera.autojoin_delay        integer  null -> 0
irc.server.libera.autojoin_dynamic      boolean  null -> off
irc.server.libera.autoreconnect         boolean  null -> on
irc.server.libera.autoreconnect_delay   integer  null -> 10

irc.server.libera.command               string   null -> ""
irc.server.libera.command_delay         integer  null -> 0
irc.server.libera.connection_timeout    integer  null -> 60
irc.server.libera.default_chantypes     string   null -> "#&"
irc.server.libera.ipv6                  enum     null -> auto
irc.server.libera.local_hostname        string   null -> ""
irc.server.libera.msg_kick              string   null -> ""
irc.server.libera.msg_part              string   null -> "WeeChat ${info:version}"
irc.server.libera.msg_quit              string   null -> "WeeChat ${info:version}"
irc.server.libera.nicks                 string   null -> "${username},${username}2,${username}3,${username}4,${username}5"
irc.server.libera.nicks_alternate       boolean  null -> on
irc.server.libera.notify                string   null -> ""
irc.server.libera.password              string   null -> ""
irc.server.libera.proxy                 string   null -> ""
irc.server.libera.realname              string   null -> ""
irc.server.libera.registered_mode       string   null -> "r"
irc.server.libera.sasl_fail             enum     null -> reconnect
irc.server.libera.sasl_key              string   null -> ""
irc.server.libera.sasl_mechanism        enum     null -> plain
irc.server.libera.sasl_password         string   "${sec.data.libera}"
irc.server.libera.sasl_timeout          integer  null -> 15
irc.server.libera.sasl_username         string   "alice"
irc.server.libera.split_msg_max_length  integer  null -> 512
irc.server.libera.tls                   boolean  null -> on
irc.server.libera.tls_cert              string   null -> ""
irc.server.libera.tls_dhkey_size        integer  null -> 2048
irc.server.libera.tls_fingerprint       string   null -> ""
irc.server.libera.tls_password          string   null -> ""
irc.server.libera.tls_priorities        string   null -> "NORMAL"
irc.server.libera.tls_verify            boolean  null -> on
irc.server.libera.usermode              string   null -> ""
irc.server.libera.username              string   null -> "${username}"
....

For example if you want to automatically connect to all servers you define
without having to do it on each server, you can do:

----
/set irc.server_default.autoconnect on
----

And then you can reset the server option so that it uses the default inherited
value, which is now `on` instead of the default value `off`:

----
/unset irc.server.libera.autoconnect
----

[[irc_tls_certificates]]
==== TLS certificates

When connecting to IRC server with TLS, WeeChat checks by default that the
connection is fully trusted.

Some options are used to control TLS connection:

weechat.network.gnutls_ca_system::
    load system's default trusted certificate authorities on startup

weechat.network.gnutls_ca_user::
    extra file(s) with certificate authorities

irc.server.xxx.tls_cert::
    TLS certificate file used to automatically identify your nick (for example
    CertFP on oftc, see below)

irc.server.xxx.tls_dhkey_size::
    size of the key used during the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (by default:
    2048)

irc.server.xxx.tls_verify::
    check that the TLS connection is fully trusted (on by default)

[NOTE]
Option "tls_verify" is on by default, so verification is strict and may fail,
even if it was OK with versions prior to 0.3.1.

[[irc_connect_oftc_with_certificate]]
===== First example: connect to oftc and check certificate

* Import certificate in shell:

[source,shell]
----
mkdir -p ~/.config/weechat/tls
wget -O ~/.config/weechat/tls/CAs.pem https://www.spi-inc.org/ca/spi-cacert.crt
----

[NOTE]
You must replace `~/.config/weechat` by the path to your WeeChat config directory
which can also be for example `~/.weechat`.

[NOTE]
It is possible to concatenate many certificates in file CAs.pem.

* In WeeChat, with "oftc" server already added:

----
/connect oftc
----

[[irc_connect_oftc_with_certfp]]
===== Second example: connect to oftc using CertFP

* Create certificate in shell:

[source,shell]
----
mkdir -p ~/.config/weechat/tls
cd ~/.config/weechat/tls
openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout nick.pem -x509 -days 365 -out nick.pem
----

[NOTE]
You must replace `~/.config/weechat` by the path to your WeeChat config directory
which can also be for example `~/.weechat`.

* In WeeChat, with "oftc" server already added:

----
/set irc.server.oftc.tls_cert "${weechat_config_dir}/tls/nick.pem"
/connect oftc
/msg nickserv cert add
----

For more information, please look at
https://www.oftc.net/NickServ/CertFP/[this page ^↗^^].

[[irc_sasl_authentication]]
==== SASL authentication

WeeChat supports SASL authentication, using different mechanisms:

* _plain_: plain text password (default)
* _scram-sha-1_: SCRAM with SHA-1 digest algorithm
* _scram-sha-256_: SCRAM with SHA-256 digest algorithm
* _scram-sha-512_: SCRAM with SHA-512 digest algorithm
* _ecdsa-nist256p-challenge_: challenge with public/private key
* _external_: client side TLS cert

Options in servers are:

* _sasl_mechanism_: mechanism to use (see above)
* _sasl_timeout_: timeout (in seconds) for authentication
* _sasl_fail_: action to perform if authentication fails
* _sasl_username_: username (nick)
* _sasl_password_: password
* _sasl_key_: file with ECC private key (for mechanism
  _ecdsa-nist256p-challenge_)

[[irc_sasl_ecdsa_nist256p_challenge]]
===== SASL ECDSA-NIST256P-CHALLENGE

You must generate a private key in order to authenticate with the
ECDSA-NIST256P-CHALLENGE mechanism (no password is required on connection).

You can generate the key with this command:

[source,shell]
----
openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out ~/.config/weechat/ecdsa.pem
----

[NOTE]
You must replace `~/.config/weechat` by the path to your WeeChat config directory
which can also be for example `~/.weechat`.

Get the public key (encoded as base64) with this command:

[source,shell]
----
openssl ec -noout -text -conv_form compressed -in ~/.config/weechat/ecdsa.pem | grep '^pub:' -A 3 | tail -n 3 | tr -d ' \n:' | xxd -r -p | base64
----

Connect to the server, identify (for example with "nickserv identify") and set
your public key in your account, using nickserv (replace the base64 value with
your public key):

----
/connect libera
/msg nickserv identify your_password
/msg nickserv set pubkey Av8k1FOGetUDq7sPMBfufSIZ5c2I/QYWgiwHtNXkVe/q
----

Configure the SASL options in the server:

----
/set irc.server.libera.sasl_mechanism ecdsa-nist256p-challenge
/set irc.server.libera.sasl_username "your_nickname"
/set irc.server.libera.sasl_key "${weechat_config_dir}/ecdsa.pem"
----

Reconnect to the server:

----
/reconnect libera
----

[[irc_servers_connection]]
==== Connection

You can connect to server with the <<command_irc_connect,/connect>> command:

----
/connect libera
----

To disconnect:

----
/disconnect libera
----

Or just this if you are on any buffer belonging to _libera_ server (server,
channel, private):

----
/disconnect
----

When you connect to multiple servers at same time, server buffers are merged
by default and you can switch between them with the kbd:[Ctrl+x] key. +
It is possible to disable auto merge of server buffers to have independent
server buffers:

----
/set irc.look.server_buffer independent
----

[[irc_tor_sasl]]
==== Connect with Tor and SASL

Some servers support connections with https://www.torproject.org/[Tor ^↗^^],
a network of virtual tunnels that allows people and groups to improve their
privacy and security on the Internet.

In first place, install Tor. For Debian (and derived):

[source,shell]
----
sudo apt-get install tor
----

In WeeChat you need to add a socks5 proxy for Tor service (hostname/IP and
port depend on your Tor configuration):

----
/proxy add tor socks5 127.0.0.1 9050
----

Now, add a new server (replace server name "irc-tor" and the address by a valid one):

----
/server add irc-tor this.is.the.address.onion
----

Set proxy for Tor:

----
/set irc.server.irc-tor.proxy "tor"
----

Set SASL authentication with ECDSA-NIST256P-CHALLENGE (see the chapter
<<irc_sasl_ecdsa_nist256p_challenge,SASL ECDSA-NIST256P-CHALLENGE>> to generate
a private key):

----
/set irc.server.irc-tor.sasl_mechanism ecdsa-nist256p-challenge
/set irc.server.irc-tor.sasl_username "your_nickname"
/set irc.server.irc-tor.sasl_key "${weechat_config_dir}/ecdsa.pem"
----

And finally, connect to the server:

----
/connect irc-tor
----

[[irc_ircv3_support]]
=== IRCv3 support

WeeChat supports the following https://ircv3.net/irc/[IRCv3 extensions ^↗^^]:

* <<irc_ircv3_account_notify,account-notify>>
* <<irc_ircv3_account_tag,account-tag>>
* <<irc_ircv3_away_notify,away-notify>>

* <<irc_ircv3_typing,typing>>
* <<irc_ircv3_userhost_in_names,userhost-in-names>>
* <<irc_ircv3_whox,WHOX>>

By default all capabilities supported by the server and WeeChat are
automatically enabled
(see option <<option_irc.server_default.capabilities,irc.server_default.capabilities>>).

Tables with comparison of different IRC clients, including WeeChat, are available
on https://ircv3.net/software/clients[this page ^↗^^].

[[irc_ircv3_account_notify]]
==== account-notify

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/account-notify[account-notify ^↗^^]

This capability allows the server to send messages when users identify or
unidentify on the server. +
WeeChat displays such messages if the option
<<option_irc.look.display_account_message,irc.look.display_account_message>>
is enabled (default value).

Examples:

....
-- alice has identified as Alice01

-- alice has unidentified
....

[[irc_ircv3_account_tag]]
==== account-tag

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/account-tag[account-tag ^↗^^]

This capability allows the server to send account as message tag to commands
sent to the client. +
WeeChat parses this tag and saves it in the message, but it is not used or
displayed. It can be used in <<command_filter,/filter>> command to filter
messages matching specific accounts.

Example of raw IRC message received:

....
@account=Alice01 :user@example.com PRIVMSG #test :Hello!
....

Message displayed in channel:

....
<alice> Hello!
....

Message with tags:

....
<alice> Hello! [irc_privmsg,irc_tag_account_Alice01,notify_message,prefix_nick_lightcyan,nick_alice,host_user@example.com,log1]
....

[[irc_ircv3_away_notify]]
==== away-notify

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/away-notify[away-notify ^↗^^]

This capability allows the server to send away notifications for users present
on the same channels as you.

When the away status is changed for a user (away or back), this is reflected
with a specific color in the nicklist, using the following options:

* <<option_irc.server_default.away_check,irc.server_default.away_check>>
* <<option_irc.server_default.away_check_max_nicks,irc.server_default.away_check_max_nicks>>
* <<option_weechat.look.item_away_message,weechat.look.item_away_message>>

[[irc_ircv3_batch]]
==== batch

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/batch[batch ^↗^^]

This capability allows the server to send batched events (grouping of several
messages that are related).

For now, WeeChat only stores messages received in a batch and processes as usual
later, when the batch ends.

[[irc_ircv3_cap_notify]]
==== cap-notify

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/capability-negotiation#the-cap-new-subcommand[cap-notify ^↗^^]

This capability allows the server to advertise on new or removed capabilities
on the server (via `CAP NEW` and `CAP DEL` commands).

Examples:

....
-- irc: client capability, now available: sasl

-- irc: client capability, removed: sasl
....

[[irc_ircv3_chghost]]
==== chghost

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/chghost[chghost ^↗^^]

This capability allows the server to send messages when users change name or host. +
When the option <<option_irc.look.smart_filter_chghost,irc.look.smart_filter_chghost>>
is enabled (default value), the host changes are automatically hidden if the nick
has not spoken for several minutes. +
The color of the change host message is controlled by the option
<<option_irc.color.message_chghost,irc.color.message_chghost>>.

Example:

....
-- alice (user@example.com) has changed host to test.com
....

[[irc_ircv3_draft_multiline]]
==== draft/multiline

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/multiline[multiline ^↗^^]

This capability allows the client and server to send messages with multiple lines,
using the <<irc_ircv3_batch,batch>> capability, that must be enabled as well.

There are limits in term of bytes or number of lines in a multiline message
that are given in the capability sent by the server, for example:

....
CAP alice LS * :draft/multiline=max-bytes=4096,max-lines=24
....

This sets a limit of 4096 bytes and 24 lines for a multiline batched content.

If the limits are not given by the server, the default in WeeChat are:

* max bytes: 4096
* max lines: 24

Only standard messages and those send by the <<command_irc_notice,/notice>>
command can be multiline. +
ACTION CTCP messages sent with command <<command_irc_me,/me>> are not affected
by this capability. That means multiline actions are sent as multiple actions.

[WARNING]
As the specification is a "draft", it may change and the multiline support can
possibly break at any time in WeeChat. +
The capability is automatically enabled if the server supports it and can be
disabled with this command:
`/set irc.server_default.capabilities "*,!draft/multiline"`. +
When the capability is disabled, a multiline message is sent as multiple messages,
as if they were sent sequentially to the server.

Example of IRC messages sent for a user message with two lines (`this is a test`
/ `on two lines`), send to channel #test:

....
BATCH +i8Je7M7gquddoyC9 draft/multiline #test
@batch=i8Je7M7gquddoyC9 PRIVMSG #test :this is a test
@batch=i8Je7M7gquddoyC9 PRIVMSG #test :on two lines
BATCH -i8Je7M7gquddoyC9
....

Display of the message sent in WeeChat:

....
19:01:45 alice | this is a test
               | on two lines
....

[[irc_ircv3_echo_message]]
==== echo-message

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/echo-message[echo-message ^↗^^]

This capability forces the server to send PRIVMSG, NOTICE and TAGMSG messages
back to WeeChat.

WeeChat displays only the message received and not the message sent, so a delay
can be noticed between the send and the display. When the message is displayed,
it means it has been properly received by the server and propagated to other
clients connected to the server as well.

[[irc_ircv3_extended_join]]
==== extended-join

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/extended-join[extended-join ^↗^^]

This capability allows the server to send account and real name when users
join channels. +
WeeChat displays this additional information in join messages if the option
<<option_irc.look.display_extended_join,irc.look.display_extended_join>>
is enabled (default value).

Example:

....
--> john [John01] (John Doe) (~user@example.com) has joined #test
....

[[irc_ircv3_invite_notify]]
==== invite-notify

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/invite-notify[invite-notify ^↗^^]

This capability allows the server to send invite messages when users are
invited to channels.

Example:

-- alice has invited bob to #test
....

[[irc_ircv3_message_tags]]
==== message-tags

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/message-tags[message-tags ^↗^^]

This capability allows to add metadata in messages. +
These tags can be displayed using the command `/debug tags`.

It must be enabled to use <<typing_notifications,typing notifications>>.

[[irc_ircv3_monitor]]
==== monitor

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/monitor[monitor ^↗^^]

This capability allows the server to send notifications when clients become
online/offline. +
WeeChat automatically uses this extension if available when using the
<<command_irc_notify,/notify>> command.

[[irc_ircv3_multi_prefix]]
==== multi-prefix

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/multi-prefix[multi-prefix ^↗^^]

This capability allows the server to send all user modes at once in
<<command_irc_names,/names>> and <<command_irc_whois,/whois>> responses. +

////
Example: output of `/names`:

....
-- Nicks #test: [@%+alice bob +carol]
....
////

[NOTE]
For now, WeeChat doesn't display all prefixes in the `/names` output, even if
they are received and properly saved internally.

Example: output of `/whois alice`:

....
-- [alice] @%+#test
....

[[irc_ircv3_sasl]]
==== SASL

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/sasl-3.2[SASL 3.2 ^↗^^]

See the dedicated chapter <<irc_sasl_authentication,SASL authentication>>.

[[irc_ircv3_server_time]]
==== server-time

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/server-time[server-time ^↗^^]

This capability allows the server to send time for messages as message tag. +
When the time is received in a message, WeeChat uses it to display the message
(it can then be displayed with a past date).

The <<relay_irc_proxy,IRC proxy>> in Relay plugin supports this capability,
so any IRC client of Relay should enable it to display the real message time
in the backlog sent upon connection.

[[irc_ircv3_setname]]
==== setname

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/setname[setname ^↗^^]

This capability lets you change your real name by using the
<<command_irc_setname,/setname>> command.

[[irc_ircv3_typing]]
==== typing

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/client-tags/typing[typing ^↗^^]

See the dedicated chapter <<typing_notifications,Typing notifications>>.

[[irc_ircv3_userhost_in_names]]
==== userhost-in-names

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/userhost-in-names[userhost-in-names ^↗^^]

This capability allows the server to send hostnames in <<command_irc_names,/names>>
responses.

[NOTE]
WeeChat doesn't display hostnames in the `/names` output.

Example of raw IRC messages received without the capability:

....
:irc.server 353 alice = #test :@alice bob +carol
....

Example of raw IRC messages received with the capability:

....
:irc.server 353 alice = #test :@alice!user1@host1 bob!user2@host2 +carol!user3@host3
....

[[irc_ircv3_whox]]
==== WHOX

Specification: https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/whox[WHOX ^↗^^]

This capability lets you request additional fields in the WHO response
(via the <<command_irc_who,/who>> command). +
WeeChat displays all additional information received in the WHO output.

[[irc_channels]]
=== Channels

You can join channels with the <<command_irc_join,/join>> command:

----
/join #channel
----

Part a channel (keeping the buffer open):

----
/part [quit message]
----

The channels you joined are not saved. If you want to join them automatically
when connecting to the server, you must set the server `autojoin` option:

----
/set irc.server.libera.autojoin "#weechat,#weechat-fr"
----

[NOTE]
Some scripts can help to automatically set this option,
see `/script search autojoin`.

Be careful, spaces can be used only to separate list of channels from keys,
for example if `#channel1` requires a key but not `#channel2`:

----
/set irc.server.libera.autojoin "#channel1,#channel2 key1"
----

For help on the format, see option <<option_irc.server_default.autojoin,irc.server_default.autojoin>>.

[[irc_private_messages]]
=== Private messages

You can send a private message with the <<command_irc_query,/query>> command,
which opens a separate buffer:

----
/query bob hi, how are you?
----

Without arguments the command just opens the buffer (or selects it if already open):

----
/query bob
----

To close the private buffer, you can do this command on the private buffer:

----
/close
----

[[irc_smart_filter]]
=== Smart filter

A smart filter is available to filter some messages when someone did not write
anything in the channel during a configurable delay:

- join: user joins the channel
- part: user leaves the channel
- quit: user quits the server
- account: user changes its account
- chghost: user changes name or host
- mode: mode changes on channel
- nick: user changes its nick
- setname: user changes its real name

Smart filter is enabled by default, but you must add a filter to hide lines on
buffers, for example:

----
/filter add irc_smart * irc_smart_filter *
----

It is possible to create filter for one channel only or channels beginning with
same name (see the <<command_weechat_filter,/filter>> command):

----
/filter add irc_smart_weechat irc.libera.#weechat* irc_smart_filter *
----

You can setup a longer delay (in minutes):

----
/set irc.look.smart_filter_delay 10
----

If someone did not write anything during last 10 minutes, its messages like
join/part/quit will be hidden by default on channel, and you can use key
kbd:[Alt+=] (toggle filters) to see them.

[[irc_ctcp_replies]]
=== CTCP replies

It is possible to customize CTCP replies, or block some CTCP queries (do not
reply).

For example, to customize reply to CTCP "VERSION", use following command:

----
/set irc.ctcp.version "I'm running WeeChat ${version}, it rocks!"
----

[NOTE]
The name of CTCP must be in lower case. That means option _irc.ctcp.VERSION_
would not work.

If you want to block CTCP "VERSION" (do not reply to a query), then set empty
string:

----
/set irc.ctcp.version ""
----

Even unknown CTCP can be customized, for example you can reply to
CTCP "BLABLA":

----
/set irc.ctcp.blabla "This is my answer to CTCP BLABLA"
----

It is possible to customize CTCP for one server only, using its internal name
before CTCP name:

----
/set irc.ctcp.libera.version "WeeChat ${version} (for libera)"
----

If you want to restore standard CTCP reply, then remove option:

----
/unset irc.ctcp.version
----

The CTCP replies are evaluated (see command <<command_weechat_eval,/eval>>) and
the following extra variables are available:

[width="100%",cols="2,4,8",options="header"]
|===
| Variable           | Description                         | Value/example

| `+${realname}+`    | Real name on IRC server             | `+John Doe+`
|===

[NOTE]
^(1)^ The Git version is the output of command `git describe`. It is known only
if WeeChat has been compiled inside the Git repository and if Git was installed.

The default CTCP replies are:

| VERSION    | `+WeeChat ${version}+`        | `+WeeChat 4.1.0-dev+`
|===

[[irc_target_buffer]]
=== Target buffer for IRC messages

It is possible to customize target buffer for IRC messages (buffer used to
display message) with options `+irc.msgbuffer.*+`.

For some IRC messages (see list below), you can use value:

current::
    current buffer (if it's IRC buffer, or on server buffer by default)

private::
    private buffer for nick, or current/server buffer if not found (according
    to option _irc.look.msgbuffer_fallback_)

server::
    server buffer

weechat::
    WeeChat "core" buffer

When option is not set (default), WeeChat chooses appropriate buffer, commonly
server or channel buffer.

Non-comprehensive list of IRC messages or alias that you can customize:

(for example: `libera.whois`).

Some examples:

* Display result of `/whois` on private buffer:

----
/set irc.msgbuffer.whois private
----

* Restore default buffer for whois (server buffer):

----
/unset irc.msgbuffer.whois
----

* Display invitation on current buffer, only for "libera" server:

----
/set irc.msgbuffer.libera.invite current
----

* Display message "303" (ison) on WeeChat "core" buffer:

----
/set irc.msgbuffer.303 weechat

[[typing_notifications]]
== Typing notifications

The typing plugin is used to inform other users you are typing messages and
show a list of users currently typing a message on the buffer.

It is used by IRC plugin on channel and private buffers, when the "message-tags"
capability is enabled (you can check with <<command_irc_cap,/cap>> command). +
Under the hood, typing client tag is used, following
https://ircv3.net/specs/client-tags/typing[this specification ^↗^^].

[[typing_activation]]
=== Activation

For privacy considerations, the typing feature is disabled by default. +
If you want to use it, you must enable options in both typing and irc plugins:

----
/set typing.look.enabled_nicks on
/set typing.look.enabled_self on
/set irc.look.typing_status_nicks on
/set irc.look.typing_status_self on
----

The typing notifications are displayed at the end of the status bar.

Example of status bar with the "typing" item: "bob" is typing a message and
"alice" was typing a message but made a pause:

....
│[12:55] [6] [irc/libera] 3:#test(+n){4} [Typing: bob, (alice)]                   │
│[@Flashy] █                                                                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
....

[[typing_signals_sent]]
=== Signals sent

When you are typing a message (not a command starting with `/`), the typing
plugin sends signals to inform other plugins (like IRC) that you are typing,
and these plugins can then send typing notifications to other users.

The following signals are sent when you are typing messages:

[width="100%",cols="1,1,5",options="header"]
|===
| Signal              | Arguments        | Description
| typing_self_typing  | Pointer: buffer. | You are typing a message.
| typing_self_paused  | Pointer: buffer. | You made a pause while typing a message.
| typing_self_cleared | Pointer: buffer. | You cleared the command line without sending the message.
| typing_self_sent    | Pointer: buffer. | You sent the message to the buffer.
|===

[[typing_signals_caught]]
=== Signals caught

The typing plugin is catching some signals that can be sent by other plugins
(like IRC), to update internal hashtables used to store the typing state of
nicks on buffers. These hashtables are used to build the content of "typing"
bar item.

The following signals are caught by the typing plugin:

[width="100%",cols="1,4,3",options="header"]
|===
| Signal | Arguments | Description

| typing_set_nick
| String: buffer pointer + ";" + state (one of: "off", "typing", "paused",
  "cleared") + ";" + nick. +
  Example: "0x1234abcd;typing;alice".
| Set typing state for a nick on a buffer.

| typing_reset_buffer
| Pointer: buffer.
| Remove typing state for all nicks on a buffer.
|===

|===

Options:

include::{autogendir}/autogen_user_options.en.adoc[tag=typing_options]

[[relay]]
== Relay

The Relay plugin is used to relay data via network, using different protocols:

* _irc_: IRC proxy: used to share connections to IRC servers with one or many
  other IRC clients
* _api_: HTTP REST API, used by WeeChat and remote interfaces to display and
  interact with WeeChat
* _weechat_: protocol used by remote interfaces to display and interact with
  WeeChat.

For _api_ and _weechat_ protocols, see the list of remote interfaces on
https://weechat.org/about/interfaces/[this page ^↗^^].

[[relay_password]]
=== Password

It is highly recommended to set a password for relay, with these commands:

----
/secure set relay mypassword
/set relay.network.password "${sec.data.relay}"
----

This password is used with all protocols.

[[relay_totp]]
=== TOTP

TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) can be used as secondary authentication
factor for _api_ and _weechat_ protocols, in addition to the password.

This is optional and increases the security level.

One-time passwords can be generated with applications, for example:

* FreeOTP:
  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.fedorahosted.freeotp[Android ^↗^^],
  https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/freeotp-authenticator/id872559395[iOS ^↗^^]
  (https://freeotp.github.io/[website ^↗^^])
* Google Authenticator:
  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2[Android ^↗^^],
  https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/google-authenticator/id388497605[iOS ^↗^^]

The TOTP secret must be set in WeeChat and the application used to generate
one-time passwords.

It must be a string encoded in base32, with only letters and digits from 2 to 7,
for example:

----
/secure set relay_totp secretpasswordbase32
/set relay.network.totp_secret "${sec.data.relay_totp}"
----

[[relay_tls]]
=== TLS

You can use TLS by creating a certificate and private key, and by using prefix
"tls." in the name of protocol.

The default path to certificate/key is defined by option
<<option_relay.network.tls_cert_key,relay.network.tls_cert_key>>.

You can create a certificate and private key with following commands:

[source,shell]
----
mkdir -p ~/.config/weechat/tls
cd ~/.config/weechat/tls
openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout relay.pem -x509 -days 365 -out relay.pem
----

[NOTE]
You must replace `~/.config/weechat` by the path to your WeeChat config directory
which can also be for example `~/.weechat`.

If WeeChat is already running, you can reload the certificate and private key
with command:

----
/relay tlscertkey
----

[[relay_irc_proxy]]
=== IRC proxy

The Relay plugin can act as an IRC proxy: it will simulate an IRC server, and
you can connect to WeeChat with any other IRC client (including WeeChat itself).

You can define one port by IRC server, or one generic port for all servers.

When using one port for all servers, the client must send the internal name of
server in the IRC "PASS" command, with this format (see example below):

----
PASS server:password
----

Example: IRC proxy with TLS for any server (client will choose):

----
/relay add tls.irc 8000
----

Example: IRC proxy without TLS only for server "libera":

----
/relay add irc.libera 8000
----

Now you can connect on port 8000 with any IRC client using server password
"mypassword" (or "libera:mypassword" if no server was specified in the relay).

For example if you use WeeChat as IRC client of the relay, with a server called
"relay" and the relay password "secret", you can setup the password with these
commands:

----
/secure set relay_libera libera:secret
/set irc.server.relay.password "${sec.data.relay_libera}"
----

[[relay_api_protocol]]
=== API protocol

The Relay plugin can send data to a remote WeeChat or interface using an
HTTP REST API protocol.

You can browse and test the API online:
https://weechat.org/api/[WeeChat Relay API ^↗^^].

You can connect with WeeChat or a remote interface, see
https://weechat.org/about/interfaces/[this page ^↗^^].

For example:

----
/relay add api 9000
----

Now you can connect on port 9000 with a WeeChat or a remote interface using
password "mypassword".

To connect to an _api_ relay running locally with WeeChat:

----
/remote add weechat http://localhost:9000 -password=mypassword
/remote connect weechat
----

To connect to an _api_ relay running elsewhere with WeeChat
(TLS is highly recommended):

----
/remote add weechat https://example.com:9000 -password=mypassword
/remote connect weechat
----

[NOTE]
The remote WeeChat must expose the same API version as the local WeeChat, so
it's highly recommended to use exactly the same WeeChat version on remote
and local client.

[[relay_weechat_protocol]]
=== WeeChat protocol

The Relay plugin can send data to remote interface using WeeChat protocol.

You can connect with a remote interface, see
https://weechat.org/about/interfaces/[this page ^↗^^].

[IMPORTANT]
WeeChat itself cannot connect to another WeeChat with this protocol.

For example:

----
/relay add weechat 9500
----

Now you can connect on port 9500 with a remote interface using password
"mypassword".

[[relay_websocket]]
=== WebSocket

WebSocket protocol (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455[RFC 6455 ^↗^^])
is supported in Relay plugin for all protocols.

The WebSocket handshake is automatically detected and socket becomes ready for
WebSocket if required headers are found in handshake and if origin is allowed
(see option
<<option_relay.network.websocket_allowed_origins,relay.network.websocket_allowed_origins>>).

A WebSocket can be opened in a HTML5 with a single line of JavaScript:

[source,javascript]
----
websocket = new WebSocket("ws://example.com:9500/weechat");
----

The port (9500 in example) is the port defined in Relay plugin.

The URI must end with "/weechat" for _irc_ and _weechat_ protocols and "/api"
for _api_ protocol.

[[relay_unix_socket]]
=== UNIX domain sockets

Using the protocol option "unix" with the `/relay add` command, you can listen
using any protocol on a UNIX domain socket at a given path. For example:

----
/relay add unix.weechat ${weechat_runtime_dir}/relay_socket
----

This allows clients to connect using the weechat protocol to
_/run/user/1000/weechat/relay_socket_. This is particularly useful to allow
SSH forwarding for relay clients, when other ports cannot be opened.

Using OpenSSH:

[source,shell]
----
ssh -L 9000:.weechat/relay_socket user@hostname
----

This redirects local relay clients connecting on port 9000 to the WeeChat
instance running on "hostname".

[[fifo_pipe]]
== FIFO pipe

You can remote control WeeChat, by sending commands or text to a FIFO pipe (if
option "fifo.file.enabled" is enabled, it is by default).

The FIFO pipe is located in WeeChat runtime directory and is called
_weechat_fifo_12345_ by default (where _12345_ is the WeeChat process id).

Syntax for the FIFO pipe commands/text is one of following:

....
  plugin.buffer *text or command here
  *text or command here
....

Backslashes can be interpreted with this format, where `*` is replaced by `\`,
allowing for example to send multiline messages:

....
  plugin.buffer \text or command here
  \text or command here
....

Some examples:

* Change nick on IRC server libera to "newnick":

[source,shell]
----
echo 'irc.server.libera */nick newnick' >/run/user/1000/weechat/weechat_fifo_12345
----

* Send a message on IRC #weechat channel:

[source,shell]
----
echo 'irc.libera.#weechat *hello!' >/run/user/1000/weechat/weechat_fifo_12345
----

* Send a multiline message on IRC #test channel, if capability "draft/multiline"
  is enabled on the ergo server:

[source,shell]
----
echo 'irc.ergo.#test \hello\n...on two lines!' >/run/user/1000/weechat/weechat_fifo_12345
----

* Send a message on current buffer:

[source,shell]
----
echo '*hello!' >/run/user/1000/weechat/weechat_fifo_12345
----

* Send two commands to unload/reload Python scripts (you have to separate them
  with "\n"):

[source,shell]
----
printf '%b' '*/python unload\n*/python autoload\n' >/run/user/1000/weechat/weechat_fifo_12345

[[trigger]]
== Trigger

Trigger is the Swiss Army knife for WeeChat: it can hook many things (signal,
modifier, print, etc.), change the content of data, and execute one or more
commands. A condition can be used to prevent the trigger to run in some
circumstances.

Using triggers require you to know how the signals, modifiers, ... are working.
So you might consider reading the
link:weechat_plugin_api.en.html#hooks[WeeChat plugin API reference / Hooks ^↗^^].

[[trigger_default]]
=== Default triggers

WeeChat creates 5 triggers by default, which can be disabled, updated or
deleted:

* a _beep_ trigger for notifications
* four other triggers to hide passwords on screen

List of default triggers:

[width="100%",cols="5m,3,22",options="header"]
|===
| Name | Hook | Description

| beep | print
| Beep on highlight/private message.

| cmd_pass | modifier
| Hide password in commands:
  `pass:[/msg nickserv id\|identify\|set password\|ghost\|release\|regain\|recover]`,
  `pass:[/oper]`,
  `pass:[/quote pass]`,
  `pass:[/secure passphrase\|decrypt\|set]`.

| cmd_pass_register | modifier
| Hide password in command `pass:[/msg nickserv register]`.

| msg_auth | modifier
| Hide password in IRC auth message displayed (message received from server
  after the user issued the command).

| server_pass | modifier
| Hide server password in commands `/server` and `/connect`.
|===

[[trigger_anatomy]]
=== Anatomy of a trigger

A trigger has the following options (names are
`trigger.trigger.<name>.<option>`):

[width="100%",cols="2m,3,10",options="header"]
|===
| Option | Values | Description

| enabled | `on`, `off`
| When option is `off`, the trigger is disabled and actions are not executed
  anymore.

| hook | `+signal+`, `+hsignal+`, `+modifier+`, `+line+`, `+print+`, `+command+`,
  `+command_run+`, `+timer+`, `+config+`, `+focus+`, `+info+`, `+info_hashtable+`
| The hook used in trigger. For more information, see
  link:weechat_plugin_api.en.html#hooks[WeeChat plugin API reference / Hooks ^↗^^].

| arguments | string
| The arguments for the hook, it depends on the hook type used.

| conditions | string
| Conditions to execute the trigger; they are evaluated (see command
  <<command_weechat_eval,/eval>>).

| regex | string
| One or more regex "commands" (similar to the `sed` command) to change data
  received in the hook callback (and some stuff added by trigger plugin), see
  <<trigger_regex,regular expression>>.

| command | string
| Command to execute (many commands can be separated by semicolons); it is
  evaluated (see command <<command_weechat_eval,/eval>>).

| return_code | `+ok+`, `+ok_eat+`, `+error+`
| The return code of callback (default is `ok`, which should be used in almost
  all triggers, the other values are rarely used).

| post_action | `none`, `disable`, `delete`
| Action to take on the trigger after execution (default is `none` which should
  be used in almost all triggers, the other values are rarely used).
|===

For example, the default _beep_ trigger has following options:

----
trigger.trigger.beep.enabled = on
trigger.trigger.beep.hook = print
trigger.trigger.beep.arguments = ""
trigger.trigger.beep.conditions = "${tg_displayed} && (${tg_highlight} || ${tg_msg_pv})"
trigger.trigger.beep.regex = ""
trigger.trigger.beep.command = "/print -beep"
trigger.trigger.beep.return_code = ok
trigger.trigger.beep.post_action = none
----

[[trigger_execution]]
=== Execution

When a trigger callback is called, following actions are executed, in this
order, if triggers are globally enabled and if the trigger itself is enabled:

. check trigger conditions: if false, exit
. replace text in trigger using regular expression(s)
. execute command(s)
. exit with a return code (except for hooks _modifier_, _line_, _focus_,
  _info_ and _info_hashtable_)
. perform post action (if different from `none`).

[[trigger_hook_arguments]]
=== Hook arguments

The arguments depend on the hook used. They are separated by semicolons.

[[trigger_conditions]]
=== Conditions

The conditions are used to continue processing in trigger, or stop everything.

They are evaluated, and data available in callback can be used
(see <<trigger_callback_data,data in callbacks>> and command
<<command_weechat_eval,/eval>>).

Example: the default _beep_ trigger uses this condition to make a beep only on
highlight or private message:

----
${tg_displayed} && (${tg_highlight} || ${tg_msg_pv})
----

[[trigger_regex]]
=== Regular expression

The regular expression is used to change variables in callback hashtable.

Format is one of the following:

----
/string1/string2
/string1/string2/var
s/string1/string2
s/string1/string2/var
y/string1/string2
y/string1/string2/var
----

Fields:

* `s` or `y`: a letter with the command; if missing, default command is `s`
  and the first char is then used as the delimiter:
** `s`: regex replacement: first string is a regular expression, second string
   is the replacement for every matching string
** `y`: chars translation: first string is a set of characters that are replaced
   by the characters in the second string; once evaluated, each string must have
   exactly the same number of UTF-8 chars
* `/`: the regex delimiter; the char "/" can be replaced by any char
  (one or more identical chars)
* `string1`: the first string (use depends on the command)
* `string2`: the second string (use depends on the command)
* `var`: the hashtable variable to update

Many regular expressions can be separated by a space, for example:

----
s/regex1/replace1/var1 y/abcdef/ABDDEF/var2
----

[[trigger_regex_replace]]
==== Regex replace

For the command `s`, the format is: `s/regex/replace` or `s/regex/replace/var`
(where _var_ is a variable of the hashtable).

As `s` is the default command, it can be omitted, so `/regex/replace` is also
valid (but the first char, which is the delimiter, must not be a letter).

Matching groups can be used in _replace_:

* `+${re:0}+` to `+${re:99}+`: `+${re:0}+` is the whole match, `+${re:1}+` to
  `+${re:99}+` are groups captured
* `pass:[${re:+}]`: the last match (with highest number)
* `+${re:#}+`: index of last group captured
* `+${re:repl_index}+`: index of replacement being done (starts to 1)
* `+${hide:c,${re:N}}+`: match "N" with all chars replaced by "c"
  (example: `+${hide:*,${re:2}}+` is the group #2 with all chars replaced by
  `+*+`).

Example: use bold for words between `+*+`:

----
s/\*([^ ]+)\*/*${color:bold}${re:1}${color:-bold}*/
----

Example: default trigger _server_pass_ uses this regular expression to hide
password in commands `/server` and `/connect` (chars in passwords are replaced
by `+*+`):

----
s==^(/(server|connect) .*-(sasl_)?password=)([^ ]+)(.*)==${re:1}${hide:*,${re:4}}${re:5}
----

[NOTE]
In this example, the delimiter used is "==" because there is a "/" in the
regular expression.

[[trigger_regex_translate_chars]]
==== Translate chars

For the command `y`, the format is: `y/chars1/chars2` or `y/chars1/chars2/var`
(where _var_ is a variable of the hashtable).

Example: replace "a", "b" and "c" by upper case letter:

----
y/abc/ABC/
----

Example: rotate arrows clockwise:

----
y/←↑→↓/↑→↓←/
----

Example: convert all letters to lower case:

----
y/${chars:upper}/${chars:lower}/
----

Example: shift each letter by one position, preserving case: a→b, b→c … y→z, z→a:

----
y/${chars:a-z}${chars:A-Z}/${chars:b-z}a${chars:B-Z}A/
----

[[trigger_regex_variable]]
==== Variable

If _var_ does not exist in the hashtable, it is created automatically with an
empty value. This allows to create custom temporary variables.

If _var_ is not specified, the default variable is used, it depends on hook
type:

[width="100%",cols="2,3,7",options="header"]
|===
| Hook           | Default variable   | Update allowed ^(1)^
| signal         | tg_signal_data     |
| hsignal        |                    |
| modifier       | tg_string          | tg_string
| line           | message            | buffer, buffer_name, y, date, date_usec, date_printed, date_usec_printed, str_time, tags, notify_level, highlight, prefix, message
| print          | tg_message         |
| command        | tg_argv_eol1       |
| command_run    | tg_command         |
| timer          | tg_remaining_calls |
| config         | tg_value           |
| focus          |                    |
| info           | tg_info            | tg_info
| info_hashtable |                    | all variables received in hashtable
|===

[NOTE]
^(1)^ All variables can be updated in the trigger, but only these variables
have an effect on the value returned by the trigger and used by WeeChat.

[[trigger_command]]
=== Command

The command is executed after replacement of text with the regular expression.
Many commands can be separated by semicolons.

It is evaluated (see command <<command_weechat_eval,/eval>>) and text replaced
with a regular expression can be used in the command.

Example: default _beep_ trigger uses this command to make a beep (BEL):

----
/print -beep
----

[[trigger_callback_data]]
=== Data in callbacks

Data received in callbacks are stored in hashtables (pointers and strings) and
can be used in following options:

* _conditions_
* _regex_
* _command_

The content of hashtables depends on the hook type.

A convenient way to see data in a trigger is to open trigger monitor buffer,
using the command:

----
/trigger monitor
----

All callbacks set following variables in hashtable:

[width="100%",cols="3m,2,14",options="header"]
|===
| Variable        | Type   | Description
| tg_trigger_name | string | Name of trigger.
| tg_hook_type    | string | Hook type: "signal", "command", etc.
|===

[[trigger_data_signal]]
==== Signal

The "signal" callback sets following variables in hashtable:

[width="100%",cols="3m,2,14",options="header"]
|===
| Variable       | Type   | Description
| tg_signal      | string | Name of signal.
| tg_signal_data | string | Data sent with the signal.
|===

If the signal contains an IRC message, the message is parsed and following data
is added in hashtable:

[width="100%",cols="3m,2,14",options="header"]
|===
| Variable             | Type    | Description
| irc_server           | pointer | Pointer to IRC server (variables in hdata of type "irc_server" can be used, like `+${irc_server.name}+`).
| irc_channel          | pointer | Pointer to IRC channel (variables in hdata of type "irc_channel" can be used, like `+${irc_channel.name}+`).
| server               | string  | Name of server (example: "libera").
| tags                 | string  | Tags in message (rarely used).
| message_without_tags | string  | Message without tags.
| nick                 | string  | Nick. ^(1)^
| host                 | string  | Hostname.
| command              | string  | IRC command (example: "PRIVMSG", "NOTICE", ...).
| channel              | string  | IRC channel.
| arguments            | string  | Arguments of command (includes value of _channel_).
| text                 | string  | Text (for example user message).
| pos_command          | string  | The index of _command_ in message ("-1" if _command_ was not found).
| pos_arguments        | string  | The index of _arguments_ in message ("-1" if _arguments_ was not found).
| pos_channel          | string  | The index of _channel_ in message ("-1" if _channel_ was not found).
| pos_text             | string  | The index of _text_ in message ("-1" if _text_ was not found).
|===

[NOTE]
^(1)^ The nick is the sender of the message. +
Your own nick on the server is `${irc_server.nick}`.

When the data is a pointer, the variable `+tg_signal_data+` can be used like this
to read a hdata property (in this example this is a pointer on a buffer):

----
${buffer[${tg_signal_data}].full_name}
----

[[trigger_data_hsignal]]
==== Hsignal

The "hsignal" callback sets following variables in hashtable:

[width="100%",cols="3m,2,14",options="header"]
|===
| Variable  | Type   | Description
| tg_signal | string | Name of signal
|===

The hashtable contains all keys/values from hashtable received (type:
string/string).

[[trigger_data_modifier]]
==== Modifier

The "modifier" callback sets following variables in hashtable:

[width="100%",cols="3m,2,14",options="header"]
|===
| Variable          | Type   | Description
| tg_modifier       | string | Name of modifier.
| tg_modifier_data  | string | Data sent with modifier.
| tg_string         | string | The string that can be modified.
| tg_string_nocolor | string | The string without color codes.
|===

For the _weechat_print_ modifier, variables using message tags are added (see
<<trigger_data_print,hook print>> below), and following variables:

[width="100%",cols="3m,2,14",options="header"]
|===
| Variable           | Type    | Description
| buffer             | pointer | Buffer where message is printed.
| tg_plugin          | string  | Plugin of buffer where message is printed.
| tg_buffer          | string  | Full name of buffer where message is printed.
| tg_prefix          | string  | Prefix of message printed.
| tg_prefix_nocolor  | string  | Prefix without color codes.
| tg_message         | string  | Message printed.
| tg_message_nocolor | string  | Message without color codes.
|===

If the modifier contains an IRC message, the message is parsed and extra data is
added in hashtable (see <<trigger_data_signal,hook signal>>).

[[trigger_data_line]]

[[trigger_examples]]
=== Examples

[[trigger_example_url_color]]
==== Color for URLs

Display URLs in green:

----
/trigger add url_color modifier weechat_print "${tg_notify}" "==[a-zA-Z0-9_]+://[^ ]+==${color:green}${re:0}${color:reset}=="
----

[NOTE]
The simple regex used to detect URL may not catch well all URLs, but it is
faster than a complex regex.

[[trigger_example_auto_pong]]
==== Auto pong on ping queries

When someone sends a "ping" in a private buffer, this trigger will auto-reply
with `pong`:

----
/trigger add pong print "" "${type} == private && ${tg_message} == ping" "" "pong"
----

[[trigger_example_responsive_layout]]
==== Responsive layout

Following triggers can be used to customize things displayed when the size of
terminal is changed:

----
/trigger add resize_small signal signal_sigwinch "${info:term_width} < 100" "" "/bar hide nicklist"
/trigger add resize_big signal signal_sigwinch "${info:term_width} >= 100" "" "/bar show nicklist"
----

The triggers catch the signal "signal_sigwinch", which is sent by WeeChat when
signal SIGWINCH is received (when terminal size is changed).

The condition with `+${info:term_width}+` checks the width of terminal (you can
also use `+${info:term_height}+` if needed).

In the example, when the terminal becomes small, the nicklist is hidden. And the
bar is restored when the width is greater or equal to 100 chars.

[[trigger_example_config_save]]
==== Automatic save of configuration

You can automatically save configuration files (`+*.conf+`), for example each
hour:

----
/trigger add cfgsave timer 3600000;0;0 "" "" "/mute /save"
----

Arguments for the timer hook are:

* _3600000_: 3600 * 1000 milliseconds, the callback is called each hour
* _0_: alignment on second (not aligned here)
* _0_: max number of calls (0 = no end for the timer)

The command `/mute /save` will silently save configuration files (nothing
displayed on core buffer).

[[extending_weechat]]
== Extending WeeChat

WeeChat has a modular design and can be extended with plugins and scripts.

It's important to make difference between a _plugin_ and a _script_: a
_plugin_ is a binary file compiled and loaded with command `/plugin`, whereas
a _script_ is a text file loaded with a plugin like _python_ with command
`/python`.

[[plugins]]
=== Plugins

A plugin is a dynamic library, written in C and compiled, which is loaded by
WeeChat.
Under GNU/Linux, the file has ".so" extension, ".dll" under Windows.

Plugins found are automatically loaded when WeeChat is starting, and it is
possible to load or unload plugins while WeeChat is running.

You can use command `/plugin` to load/unload a plugin, or list all loaded
plugins.

When a plugin is unloaded, WeeChat removes:

* buffers
* configuration options (options are written in files)
* all hooks: commands, modifiers, process, etc.
* infos and infolists
* hdata
* bar items.

Examples to load, unload or list plugins:

----
/plugin load irc
/plugin unload irc
/plugin list
----

Default plugins are:

[width="100%",cols="1,5",options="header"]
|===
| Plugin     | Description
| alias      | Define alias for commands.
| buflist    | Bar item with list of buffers.
| charset    | Charset decoding/encoding for buffers.
| exec       | Execution of external commands in WeeChat.
| fifo       | FIFO pipe used to remotely send commands to WeeChat.
| fset       | Fast set of WeeChat and plugins options.
| irc        | IRC chat protocol.
| logger     | Log buffers to files.
| relay      | Relay data via network.
| script     | Script manager.
| python     | Python scripting API.
| perl       | Perl scripting API.
| ruby       | Ruby scripting API.
| lua        | Lua scripting API.
| tcl        | Tcl scripting API.
| guile      | Guile (scheme) scripting API.
| javascript | JavaScript scripting API.
| php        | PHP scripting API.
| spell      | Spell checking for command line.
| trigger    | Text replacement and command execution on events triggered by WeeChat/plugins.
| typing     | Display users currently writing messages.
| xfer       | File transfer and direct chat.
|===

To learn more about plugin or script development (through API), please read the
link:weechat_plugin_api.en.html[WeeChat plugin API reference ^↗^^] or the
link:weechat_scripting.en.html[WeeChat scripting guide ^↗^^].

[[scripts]]
=== Scripts

WeeChat provides 8 scripting plugins: Python, Perl, Ruby, Lua, Tcl, Guile
(scheme), JavaScript and PHP.
These plugins can load, execute and unload scripts for these languages.

For more information about how to write scripts, or WeeChat API for
scripts, please read the link:weechat_scripting.en.html[WeeChat scripting guide ^↗^^].

[[script_manager]]
==== Script manager

The script manager (command <<command_script_script,/script>>) is used to
load/unload scripts of any language, and install/remove scripts of WeeChat
scripts repository, which are visible on
https://weechat.org/scripts/[this page ^↗^^].

For privacy considerations, the download of scripts is disabled by default. +
To enable it, type this command:

----
/script enable
----

Then you can download the list of scripts and display them in a new buffer
with the <<command_script_script,/script>> command:
