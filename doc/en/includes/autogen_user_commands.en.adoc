addreplace: add or replace an existing filter
    rename: rename a filter
  recreate: set input with the command used to edit the filter
       del: delete a filter
      -all: delete all filters
    buffer: comma separated list of buffers where filter is active:
            - this is full name including plugin (example: "irc.libera.#weechat" or "irc.server.libera")
            - "*" means all buffers
            - a name starting with '!' is excluded
            - wildcard "*" is allowed
   tags: comma separated list of tags, for example "irc_join,irc_part,irc_quit"
            - logical "and": use "+" between tags (for example: "nick_toto+irc_action")
            - wildcard "*" is allowed
            - if tag starts with '!', then it is excluded and must NOT be in message
  regex: POSIX extended regular expression to search in line
            - use '\t' to separate prefix from message, special chars like '|' must be escaped: '\|'
            - if regex starts with '!', then matching result is reversed (use '\!' to start with '!')
            - two regular expressions are created: one for prefix and one for message
            - regex are case insensitive, they can start by "(?-i)" to become case sensitive

The default key alt+'=' toggles filtering on/off globally and alt+'-' toggles filtering on/off in the current buffer.

Tags most commonly used:
  no_filter, no_highlight, no_log, log0..log9 (log level),
  notify_none, notify_message, notify_private, notify_highlight,
  self_msg, nick_xxx (xxx is nick in message), prefix_nick_ccc (ccc is color of nick),
  host_xxx (xxx is username + host in message),
  irc_xxx (xxx is command name or number, see /server raw or /debug tags),
  irc_numeric, irc_error, irc_action, irc_ctcp, irc_ctcp_reply, irc_smart_filter, away_info.
To see tags for lines in buffers: /debug tags

Examples:
  use IRC smart filter on all buffers:
    /filter add irc_smart * irc_smart_filter *
  use IRC smart filter on all buffers except those with "#weechat" in name:
    /filter add irc_smart *,!*#weechat* irc_smart_filter *
  filter all IRC join/part/quit messages:
    /filter add joinquit * irc_join,irc_part,irc_quit *

  filter nick "toto" on IRC channel #weechat:
    /filter add toto irc.libera.#weechat nick_toto *
  filter IRC join/action messages from nick "toto":
    /filter add toto * nick_toto+irc_join,nick_toto+irc_action *
  filter lines containing "weechat sucks" on IRC channel #weechat:
    /filter add sucks irc.libera.#weechat * weechat sucks
  filter lines that are strictly equal to "WeeChat sucks" on all buffers:
    /filter add sucks2 * * (?-i)^WeeChat sucks$

For context "mouse" (possible in context "cursor" too), key has format: "@area:key" or "@area1>area2:key" where area can be:
          *: any area on screen
       chat: chat area (any buffer)

     bar(*): any bar
   bar(xxx): bar "xxx"
    item(*): any bar item
  item(xxx): bar item "xxx"
Wildcard "*" is allowed in key to match many mouse events.
A special value for command with format "hsignal:name" can be used for context mouse, this will send the hsignal "name" with the focus hashtable as argument.
Another special value "-" can be used to disable key (it will be ignored when looking for keys).

Examples:
  key alt-t to toggle nicklist bar:
    /key bind meta-t /bar toggle nicklist
  key alt-r to jump to #weechat IRC channel:
    /key bind meta-r /buffer #weechat

It is possible to set environment variable "WEECHAT_PASSPHRASE" to prevent the prompt (this same variable is used by WeeChat on /upgrade), or to set option sec.crypt.passphrase_command to read the passphrase from the output of an external command like a password manager (see /help sec.crypt.passphrase_command).

Secured data with format ${sec.data.xxx} can be used in:
  - command /eval
  - command line argument "--run-command"
  - options weechat.startup.command_{before|after}_plugins
  - other options that may contain a password or sensitive data (for example proxy, irc server and relay); see /help on the options to check if they are evaluated.

Examples:
  set a passphrase:
    /secure passphrase this is my passphrase
  use program "pass" to read the passphrase on startup:
    /set sec.crypt.passphrase_command "/usr/bin/pass show weechat/passphrase"
  encrypt libera SASL password:
    /secure set libera mypassword
    /set irc.server.libera.sasl_password "${sec.data.libera}"
  encrypt oftc password for nickserv:
    /secure set oftc mypassword
    /set irc.server.oftc.command "/msg nickserv identify ${sec.data.oftc}"
  alias to ghost the nick "mynick":
    /alias add ghost /eval /msg -server libera nickserv ghost mynick ${sec.data.libera}

[[command_weechat_set]]
* `+set+`: set config options and environment variables

----
/set  [<option> [<value>]]
      diff [<option> [<option>...]]
      env [<variable> [<value>]]

option: name of an option (wildcard "*" is allowed to list options, if no value is specified)
 value: new value for option, according to type:
          boolean: on, off or toggle
          integer: number, ++number or --number
           string: any string ("" for empty string)
            color: color name, ++number or --number
        Note: for all types, you can use null to remove option value (undefined value). This works only for some special plugin variables.
  diff: display only changed options
   env: display or set an environment variable (use value "" to unset a variable)

Examples:
  display options about highlight:
    /set *highlight*
  add a word to highlight:
    /set weechat.look.highlight "word"
  display changed options:
    /set diff
  display changed options in irc plugin:
    /set diff irc.*
  display value of environment variable LANG:
    /set env LANG
  set environment variable LANG and use it:
    /set env LANG fr_FR.UTF-8
    /upgrade
  unset environment variable ABC:
    /set env ABC ""
----

[[command_weechat_toggle]]
* `+toggle+`: toggle value of a config option

----
/toggle  <option> [<value> [<value>...]]

option: name of an option
 value: possible values for the option (values are split like the shell command arguments: quotes can be used to preserve spaces at the beginning/end of values)

Behavior:
  - only an option of type boolean or string can be toggled without a value:
      - boolean: toggle between on/off according to current value
      - string: toggle between empty string and default value (works only if empty string is allowed for the option)
  - with a single value given, toggle between this value and the default value of option
  - with multiple values given, toggle between these values: the value used is the one following the current value of option; if the current value of option is not in list, the first value in the list is used
  - the special value "null" can be given, but only as first value in the list and without quotes around.

Examples:
  toggle display of time in chat area (without displaying the new value used):
    /mute /toggle weechat.look.buffer_time_format
  switch format of time in chat area (with seconds, without seconds, disabled):
    /toggle weechat.look.buffer_time_format "%H:%M:%S" "%H:%M" ""
  toggle autojoin of #weechat channel on libera server:
    /toggle irc.server.libera.autojoin null #weechat
----

[[command_weechat_unset]]
* `+unset+`: unset/reset config options

----
/unset  <option>
        -mask <option>

option: name of an option
 -mask: use a mask in option (wildcard "*" is allowed to mass-reset options, use carefully!)

According to option, it's reset (for standard options) or removed (for optional settings, like server values).

Examples:
  reset one option:
    /unset weechat.look.item_time_format
  reset all color options:
    /unset -mask weechat.color.*
----

[[command_weechat_upgrade]]
* `+upgrade+`: save WeeChat session and reload the WeeChat binary without disconnecting from servers

----
/upgrade  [-yes] [<path_to_binary>|-save|-quit]

          -yes: required if option "weechat.look.confirm_upgrade" is enabled
path_to_binary: path to WeeChat binary (default is current binary)
        -dummy: do nothing (option used to prevent accidental completion with "-quit")
         -save: only save the session, do not quit nor reload WeeChat; the configuration files are not saved (if needed you can use /save before this command)
         -quit: close *ALL* connections, save session and quit WeeChat, which makes possible a delayed restoration (see below)

This command upgrades and reloads a running WeeChat session. The new WeeChat binary must have been compiled or installed with a package manager before running this command.

Note: SSL connections are lost during upgrade (except with -save), because the reload of SSL sessions is currently not possible with GnuTLS. There is automatic reconnection after upgrade.

Important: use of option -save can be dangerous, it is recommended to use only /upgrade (or with -quit) for a standard upgrade and a restart; the option -save can be used to save the session regularly and restore it in case of after abnormal exit (power outage, crash, etc.)

Upgrade process has 4 steps:
  1. save session into files for core and plugins (buffers, history, ..)
  2. unload all plugins (configuration files (*.conf) are written on disk)
  3. save WeeChat configuration (weechat.conf)
  4. execute new WeeChat binary and reload session.

With option "-quit", the process is:
  1. close *ALL* connections (irc, xfer, relay, ...)
  2. save session into files (*.upgrade)
  3. unload all plugins
  4. save WeeChat configuration
  5. quit WeeChat

With option "-save", the process is:
  1. save session into files (*.upgrade) with a disconnected state for IRC servers and Relay clients (but no disconnection is made)

With -quit or -save, you can restore the session later with this command: weechat --upgrade
IMPORTANT: you must restore the session with exactly same configuration (files *.conf) and if possible the same WeeChat version (or a more recent one).
It is possible to restore WeeChat session on another machine if you copy the content of WeeChat home directories (see /debug dirs).

 -o: send version to current buffer as input (English string)
-ol: send version to current buffer as input (translated string)

The default alias /v can be used to execute this command on all buffers (otherwise the irc command /version is used on irc buffers).
----

[[command_weechat_wait]]
* `+wait+`: schedule a command execution in future

----
/wait  <number>[<unit>] <command>

 number: amount of time to wait (integer number)

            h: hours
command: command to execute (or text to send to buffer if command does not start with '/')

Note: the command is executed on buffer where /wait was executed (if the buffer does not exist any more, the command is not executed).

Examples:
  join channel in 10 seconds:
    /wait 10 /join #test
  set away in 15 minutes:
    /wait 15m /away -all I'm away
  say 'hello' in 2 minutes:

    /window b1
  scroll 2 lines up:
    /window scroll -2
  scroll 2 days up:
    /window scroll -2d
  scroll to beginning of current day:
    /window scroll -d
  zoom on window #2:
    /window zoom -window 2
  split window horizontally using 30% of space for the window on top:
    /window splith 30
  resize window to 75% of the parent window size:
    /window resize 75
  resize vertical split, add 10% in size:
    /window resize v+10
  remove the split, keep the current window:
    /window merge

----
/fifo  enable|disable|toggle

 enable: enable FIFO pipe

 toggle: toggle FIFO pipe

FIFO pipe is used as remote control of WeeChat: you can send commands or text to the FIFO pipe from your shell.
By default the FIFO pipe is called weechat_fifo_xxx (where xxx is the WeeChat process id) and located in the WeeChat runtime directory (see /debug dirs).

The expected format is one of:
  plugin.buffer *text or command here
  *text or command here

For example to change your libera nick:
  echo 'irc.server.libera */nick newnick' >/run/user/1000/weechat/weechat_fifo_12345

When a trigger callback is called, following actions are performed, in this order:
  1. check conditions; if false, exit
  2. replace text using POSIX extended regular expression(s) (if defined in trigger)
  3. execute command(s) (if defined in trigger)
  4. exit with a return code (except for modifier, line, focus, info and info_hashtable)
  5. perform post action

Examples (you can also look at default triggers with /trigger listdefault):
  add text attributes *bold*, _underline_ and /italic/ (only in user messages):
    /trigger add effects modifier weechat_print "${tg_tag_nick}" "==\*([^ ]+)\*==*${color:bold}${re:1}${color:-bold}*== ==_([^ ]+)_==_${color:underline}${re:1}${color:-underline}_== ==/([^ ]+)/==/${color:italic}${re:1}${color:-italic}/"
  hide nicklist bar on small terminals:
    /trigger add resize_small signal signal_sigwinch "${info:term_width} < 100" "" "/bar hide nicklist"
    /trigger add resize_big signal signal_sigwinch "${info:term_width} >= 100" "" "/bar show nicklist"
