[[general]]
== General

[[weechat_name]]
=== Where does the name "WeeChat" come from?

"Wee" is a recursive acronym and stands for "Wee Enhanced Environment".
So complete name is "Wee Enhanced Environment for Chat".

"Wee" also means "very small" (and yes, there is other meaning, but it does not
apply to WeeChat!).

[[why_choose_weechat]]
=== Why choose WeeChat? X-Chat and Irssi are so good...

Because WeeChat is very light and brings innovating features.

More info on the WeeChat
https://weechat.org/about/features/[features page ^↗^^].

[[compilation_install]]
== Compilation / install

[[gui]]
=== I've heard about many GUIs for WeeChat. How can I compile/use them?

Some remote GUIs are available, see the
https://weechat.org/about/interfaces/[remote interfaces page ^↗^^].

[[compile_git]]
=== I can't compile WeeChat after cloning git repository, why?

WeeChat must be compiled with CMake.

Please follow link:weechat_user.en.html#source_package[build instructions ^↗^^]
and ensure all required dependencies are installed.

If you still have issues, please report them to the developers.

[[compile_macos]]
=== How can I install WeeChat on macOS?

It is recommended to use https://brew.sh/[Homebrew ^↗^^],
you can get help with:

[source,shell]
----
brew info weechat
----

You can install WeeChat with this command:

[source,shell]
----
brew install weechat
----

[[lost]]
=== I've launched WeeChat, but I'm lost, what can I do?

For help you can type `/help`. For help about a command, type `/help command`.
link:weechat_user.en.html#key_bindings[Keys ^↗^^] and
link:weechat_user.en.html#commands_and_options[commands ^↗^^]
are listed in documentation.

It's recommended for new users to read the
link:weechat_quickstart.en.html[Quickstart guide ^↗^^].

[[display]]
== Display

[[charset]]
=== I don't see some chars with accents, what can I do?

It's a common issue with a variety of causes, please read carefully and check
*ALL* solutions below:

* Check that weechat is linked to libncursesw (warning: needed on most
  distributions but not all): `ldd /path/to/weechat`.
* Check that the "charset" plugin is loaded with `/plugin` command (if it is
  not, then you probably need the "weechat-plugins" package).
* Check the output of command `/charset` (on core buffer). You should see
  _ISO-XXXXXX_ or _UTF-8_ for terminal charset. If you see _ANSI_X3.4-1968_ or
  other values, your locale is probably wrong. +
  To fix your locale, check the installed locales with `locale -a` and set
  an appropriate value in $LANG, for example: `+export LANG=en_US.UTF-8+`.
* Setup global decode value, for example:
  `/set charset.default.decode "ISO-8859-15"`.
* If you are using UTF-8 locale:
** Check that your terminal is UTF-8 ready (terminal recommended for UTF-8 is
   rxvt-unicode).
** If you are using screen, check that it is run with UTF-8 mode
   ("`defutf8 on`" in ~/.screenrc or `screen -U` to run screen).
* Check that option
  link:weechat_user.en.html#option_weechat.look.eat_newline_glitch[_weechat.look.eat_newline_glitch_ ^↗^^]
  is off (this option may cause display bugs).

[NOTE]
UTF-8 locale is recommended for WeeChat. If you're using ISO or other
locale, please check that *all* your settings (terminal, screen, ..) are ISO
and *not* UTF-8.

[[unicode_chars]]
=== Some unicode chars are displayed in terminal but not in WeeChat, why?

This may be caused by a libc bug in function _wcwidth_, which should be fixed
in glibc 2.22 (maybe not yet available in your distribution).

There is a workaround to use the fixed _wcwidth_ function:
https://blog.nytsoi.net/2015/05/04/emoji-support-for-weechat[https://blog.nytsoi.net/2015/05/04/emoji-support-for-weechat ^↗^^]

See this https://github.com/weechat/weechat/issues/79[bug report ^↗^^]
for more information.

[[bars_background]]
=== Bars like title and status are not filled, background color stops after text, why?

This may be caused by a bad value of the TERM variable in your shell (look at
the output of `echo $TERM` in your terminal).

Depending on where you launch WeeChat, you should have:

* If WeeChat runs locally or on a remote machine without screen nor tmux, it
  depends on the terminal used: _xterm_, _xterm-256color_, _rxvt-unicode_,
  _rxvt-256color_, etc.
* If WeeChat runs under screen, you should have _screen_ or _screen-256color_.
* If WeeChat runs under tmux, you should have _tmux_, _tmux-256color_,
  _screen_ or _screen-256color_.

If needed, fix your TERM variable: `export TERM="xxx"`.

[[screen_weird_chars]]
=== When I'm using weechat under screen/tmux, I have weird random chars, how do I fix that?

This may be caused by bad value of the TERM variable in your shell (look at
output of `echo $TERM` in your terminal, *outside screen/tmux*). +
For example, _xterm-color_ may display such weird chars, you can use _xterm_
which is OK (like many other values). +
If needed, fix your TERM variable: `export TERM="xxx"`.

If you are using gnome-terminal, check that the option
"Ambiguous-width characters" in menu Preferences/Profile/Compatibility
is set to `narrow`.

[[macos_display_broken]]
=== I compiled WeeChat under macOS, and I see "(null)" everywhere on screen, what's wrong?

If you compiled ncursesw yourself, try to use standard ncurses (that comes with
system).

Moreover, under macOS, it is recommended to install WeeChat with Homebrew
package manager.

[[buffer_vs_window]]
=== I've heard about "buffers" and "windows", what's the difference?

A _buffer_ is composed by a number, a name, lines displayed (and some other
data).

A _window_ is a screen area which displays a buffer. It is possible to split
your screen into many windows.

Each window displays one buffer, or a set of merged buffers.
A buffer can be hidden (not displayed by a window) or displayed by one or more
windows.

[[buffers_list]]
=== How to display the buffers list on the left side?

The plugin link:weechat_user.en.html#buflist[buflist ^↗^^]
is loaded and enabled by default.

To limit size of bar:

----
/set weechat.bar.buflist.size_max 15
----

To move bar to bottom:

----
/set weechat.bar.buflist.position bottom
----

To scroll the bar: if mouse is enabled (key: kbd:[Alt+m]), you can scroll the
bar with your mouse wheel.

Default keys to scroll _buflist_ bar are kbd:[F1] (or kbd:[Ctrl+F1]), kbd:[F2]
(or kbd:[Ctrl+F2]), kbd:[Alt+F1] and kbd:[Alt+F2].

[[customize_buflist]]
=== How can I customize the list of buffers list, like the color of the active buffer?

You can browse all buflist options with the command:

----
/fset buflist
----

The background of the active buffer is blue by default, you can change it
like this, for example to `red`:

----
/set buflist.format.buffer_current "${color:,red}${format_buffer}"
----

[NOTE]
There's a comma before the color name "red" because it is used as the background,
not the text color. +
You can also use any numeric color instead of `red`,
like `237` for dark gray.

The buflist plugin provides lot of options that you can customize, please read
the help on each option.

There's also a https://github.com/weechat/weechat/wiki/buflist[wiki page ^↗^^]
with examples of advanced buflist configuration.

[[customize_prefix]]
=== How can I reduce length of nicks or remove nick alignment in chat area?

To reduce max length of nicks in chat area:

----
/set weechat.look.prefix_align_max 15
----

To remove nick alignment:

----
/set weechat.look.prefix_align none
----

[[status_hotlist]]
=== What does the [H: 3(1,8), 2(4)] in status bar mean?

This is called the "hotlist", a list of buffers with the number of unread
messages, by order: highlights, private messages, messages, other messages
(like join/part). +
The number of "unread message" is the number of new messages displayed/received
since you visited the buffer.

In the example `[H: 3(1,8), 2(4)]`, there are:

* 1 highlight and 8 unread messages on buffer #3,
* 4 unread messages on buffer #2.

The color of the buffer/counter depends on the type of message, default colors
are:

* highlight: `lightmagenta` / `magenta`
* private message: `lightgreen` / `green`
* message: `yellow` / `brown`
* other message: `default` / `default` (color of text in terminal)

These colors can be changed with the options __weechat.color.status_data_*__
(buffers) and __weechat.color.status_count_*__ (counters). +
Other hotlist options can be changed with the options __weechat.look.hotlist_*__.

See link:weechat_user.en.html#screen_layout[User's guide / Screen layout ^↗^^]
for more info about the hotlist.

[[input_bar_size]]
=== How to use command line with more than one line?

The option _size_ in input bar can be set to a value higher than 1 (for fixed
size, default size is 1) or 0 for dynamic size, and then option _size_max_ will
set the max size (0 = no limit).

Example with dynamic size:

----
/set weechat.bar.input.size 0
----

Max size of 2:

----
/set weechat.bar.input.size_max 2
----

[[one_input_root_bar]]
=== Is it possible to display only one input bar for all windows (after split)?

Yes, you will have to create a bar with type "root" (with an item to know in
which window you are), then delete current input bar.

For example:

----
/bar add rootinput root bottom 1 0 [buffer_name]+[input_prompt]+(away),[input_search],[input_paste],input_text
/bar del input
----

If ever you are not satisfied with that, just delete new bar, WeeChat will
automatically create default bar "input" if item "input_text" is not used in
any bar:

----
/bar del rootinput
----

[[terminal_copy_paste]]
=== How can I copy/paste text without pasting nicklist?

You can use the bare display (default key: kbd:[Alt+l] (`L`)), which shows
just the contents of the currently selected window, without any formatting.

You can use a terminal with rectangular selection (like rxvt-unicode,
konsole, gnome-terminal, etc.). Key is usually kbd:[Ctrl] + kbd:[Alt] + mouse
selection.

You can toggle nicklist and make it visible only when needed, with key
kbd:[Alt+Shift+N].

Another solution is to move nicklist to top or bottom, for example:

----
/set weechat.bar.nicklist.position top
/set weechat.bar.nicklist.size_max 8
----

[[urls]]
=== How can I click on long URLs (more than one line)?

You can use the bare display (default key: kbd:[Alt+l] (`L`)).

To make opening URLs easier, you can:

* toggle nicklist and make it visible only when needed, with key kbd:[Alt+Shift+N]

* move nicklist to top:

----
/set weechat.bar.nicklist.position top
/set weechat.bar.nicklist.size_max 8
----

* disable alignment for multiline words:

----
/set weechat.look.align_multiline_words off
----

* or for all wrapped lines:

----
/set weechat.look.align_end_of_lines time
----

You can enable option "eat_newline_glitch", so that new line char is not added
at the end of each line displayed (it will not break URL selection):

----
/set weechat.look.eat_newline_glitch on
----

[IMPORTANT]
This option may cause display bugs. If you experience such problem, you must
turn off this option.

Other solution is to use a script:

----
/script search url
----

[[change_locale_without_quit]]
=== I want to change the language used by WeeChat for messages, but without exiting WeeChat, is it possible?

Sure it is possible:

----
/set env LANG en_US.UTF-8
/upgrade
----

[[timezone]]
=== How can I change the timezone?

There is no option in WeeChat to change the timezone, the environment variable
`TZ` must be set to the appropriate value.

In your shell initialization file or on command line, before starting WeeChat:

[source,shell]
----
export TZ=America/New_York
----

In WeeChat, the new value is immediately used:

----
/set env TZ America/New_York
----

[[use_256_colors]]
=== How can I use 256 colors in WeeChat?

First check that your _TERM_ environment variable is correct, recommended values
are:

* under screen: _screen-256color_
* under tmux: _screen-256color_ or _tmux-256color_
* outside screen/tmux: _xterm-256color_, _rxvt-256color_, _putty-256color_, ...

[NOTE]
You may have to install package "ncurses-term" to use these values in _TERM_
variable.

If you are using screen, you can add this line to your _~/.screenrc_:

----
term screen-256color
----

If your _TERM_ variable has a wrong value and that WeeChat is already running,
you can change it with these two commands:

----
/set env TERM screen-256color
/upgrade
----

You can use any color number in options (optional: you can add color aliases
with command `/color`).

Please read the link:weechat_user.en.html#colors[User's guide / Colors ^↗^^]
for more information about colors management.

[[search_text]]
=== How can I search text in buffer (like /lastlog in irssi)?

The default key is kbd:[Ctrl+r] (command is: `+/input search_text_here+`).
And jump to highlights: kbd:[Alt+p] / kbd:[Alt+n].

See link:weechat_user.en.html#key_bindings[User's guide / Key bindings ^↗^^]
for more info about this feature.

[[terminal_focus]]
=== How can I execute commands when terminal gets/loses focus?

You must enable the focus events with a special code sent to terminal.

*Important*:

* You must use a modern xterm-compatible terminal.
* Additionally, it seems to be important that your value of the TERM variable
  equals to _xterm_ or _xterm-256color_.
* If you use tmux, you must additionally enable focus events by adding
  `set -g focus-events on` to your _.tmux.conf_ file.
* This does *not* work under screen.

To send the code when WeeChat is starting:

----
/set weechat.startup.command_after_plugins "/print -stdout \033[?1004h\n"
----

And then you bind two keys for the focus (replace the `/print` commands by the
commands of your choice):

----
/key bind meta-[I /print -core focus
/key bind meta-[O /print -core unfocus
----

For example to mark buffers as read when the terminal loses the focus:

----
/key bind meta-[O /allbuf /buffer set unread
----

[[screen_paste]]
=== When WeeChat is running in screen, pasting text in another screen window adds ~0 and ~1 around text, why?

This is caused by the bracketed paste option which is enabled by default, and
not properly handled by screen in other windows.

You can just disable bracketed paste mode:

----
/set weechat.look.paste_bracketed off
----

[[small_terminal]]
=== How can I customize display for very small terminal size (like 80x25), to not waste space?

You can remove side bars (buflist and nicklist), change time format to display
only hours and minutes, disable alignment of messages and set a char for nick
prefix/suffix:

----
/set buflist.look.enabled off
/bar hide nicklist
/set weechat.look.buffer_time_format "%H:%M"
/set weechat.look.prefix_align none
/set weechat.look.align_end_of_lines prefix
/set weechat.look.nick_suffix ">"
/set weechat.look.nick_prefix "<"
----

Terminal 80x25, with default configuration:

[[key_bindings]]
== Key bindings

[[meta_keys]]
=== Some meta keys (alt + key) are not working, why?

If you're using some terminals like xterm or uxterm, some meta keys do not
work by default. You can add a line in file _~/.Xresources_:

* For xterm:
----
XTerm*metaSendsEscape: true
----
* For uxterm:
----
UXTerm*metaSendsEscape: true
----

And then reload resources (`xrdb -override ~/.Xresources`) or restart X.

If you are using the macOS Terminal app, enable the option
"Use option as meta key" in menu Settings/Keyboard after which you can use the
kbd:[Option] key as meta key.

[[enter_key]]
=== Some keys including Enter are not working, why?

If you run a WeeChat < 4.0.0 with configuration files created by any
version ≥ 4.0.0, the keys names become invalid and many keys won't work at all. +
To repair them, exit WeeChat, remove all sections `[key*]` from weechat.conf
and start WeeChat again: all default keys will be created.

[[key_f11]]
=== Key F11 maximizes the terminal window, how can I scroll up the nicklist?

The key kbd:[F11] is commonly used by terminals to maximize the window, and
kbd:[F11]/kbd:[F12] are the default keys in WeeChat to scroll the nicklist.

You can bind other keys, for example kbd:[Shift+F11] and kbd:[Shift+F12],
with WeeChat ≥ 4.0.0:

----
/key bind shift-f11 /bar scroll nicklist * -100%
/key bind shift-f12 /bar scroll nicklist * +100%
----

Other solution is to enable mouse (key: kbd:[Alt+m]) and scroll with the mouse
wheel (see also questions about <<mouse,mouse>>).

[[customize_key_bindings]]
=== How can I customize key bindings?

Key bindings are customizable with `/key` command.

Default key kbd:[Alt+k] lets you grab key code and insert it in command line.

[[jump_to_buffer_11_or_higher]]
=== What is the key to jump to buffer 11 (or higher number)?

The key is kbd:[Alt+j] and then 2 digits, for example kbd:[Alt+j], kbd:[1],
kbd:[1] to jump to buffer 11.

You can bind a key, for example:

----
/key bind meta-q /buffer *11
----

List of default keys is in
link:weechat_user.en.html#key_bindings[User's guide / Key bindings ^↗^^].

To jump to buffers with number ≥ 100, you could define a trigger and then use
commands like `/123` to jump to buffer #123:

----
/trigger add numberjump modifier "2000|input_text_for_buffer" "${tg_string} =~ ^/[0-9]+$" "=\/([0-9]+)=/buffer *${re:1}=" "" "" "none"
----

For an easy jump to buffers, you can also install the _go.py_ script:

----
/script install go.py
----

[[global_history]]
=== How to use global history (instead of buffer history) with up and down keys?

You can bind the up and down keys on global history (default keys for global
history are kbd:[Ctrl+↑] and kbd:[Ctrl+↓]).

Example:

----
/key bind up /input history_global_previous
/key bind down /input history_global_next
----

With WeeChat ≤ 3.8, you must use the raw key code (press kbd:[Alt+k] then key
to display its code):

----
/key bind meta2-A /input history_global_previous
/key bind meta2-B /input history_global_next
----

[[mouse]]
== Mouse

[[mouse_not_working]]
=== Mouse is not working at all, what can I do?

First try to enable mouse:

----
/mouse enable
----

If mouse is still not working, check the TERM variable in your shell (look at
output of `echo $TERM` in your terminal).
According to terminfo used, mouse may not be supported.

You can test mouse support in terminal:

[source,shell]
----
printf '\033[?1002h'
----

And then click on first char of terminal (upper left). You should see " !!#!!".

To disable mouse in terminal:

[source,shell]
----
printf '\033[?1002l'
----

[[mouse_coords]]
=== Mouse does nothing for X or Y greater than 94 (or 222), why?

Some terminals are sending only ISO chars for mouse coordinates, so it does not
work for X/Y greater than 94 (or 222).

You should use a terminal that supports UTF-8 coordinates for mouse, like
rxvt-unicode.

[[mouse_select_paste]]
=== How can I select or paste text in terminal when mouse is enabled in WeeChat?

When mouse is enabled in WeeChat, you can use kbd:[Shift] modifier to select or
click in terminal, as if the mouse was disabled (on some terminals like iTerm,
you have to use kbd:[Alt] instead of kbd:[Shift]).

[[irc]]
== IRC

[[irc_tls_connection]]
=== I have some problems when connecting to a server using TLS, what can I do?

If you are using macOS, you must install `openssl` from Homebrew.
A CA file will be bootstrapped using certificates from the system keychain.

If you see errors about gnutls handshake, you can try to use a smaller
Diffie-Hellman key (default is 2048):

----
/set irc.server.example.tls_dhkey_size 1024
----

If you see errors about certificate, you can disable "tls_verify" (be careful,
connection will be less secure by doing that):

----
/set irc.server.example.tls_verify off
----

If the server has an invalid certificate and you know what the certificate
should be, you can specify the fingerprint (SHA-512, SHA-256 or SHA-1):

----
/set irc.server.example.tls_fingerprint 0c06e399d3c3597511dc8550848bfd2a502f0ce19883b728b73f6b7e8604243b
----

[[irc_tls_handshake_error]]
=== When connecting to server with TLS, I only see the error "TLS handshake failed", what can I do?

You can try a different priority string, replace "xxx" by your server name:

----
/set irc.server.xxx.tls_priorities "NORMAL:%COMPAT"
----

[[irc_tls_libera]]
=== How can I connect to libera server using TLS?

Check that you have certificates installed on your system, this is commonly
provided by the package "ca-certificates".

Setup server port, TLS, then connect:

----
/set irc.server.libera.addresses "irc.libera.chat/6697"
/set irc.server.libera.tls on
/connect libera
----

[[irc_oauth]]
=== How to connect to a server that requires "oauth"?

Some servers like _twitch_ require oauth to connect.

The oauth is simply a password with the value "oauth:XXXX".

You can add such server and connect with following commands (replace name
and address by appropriate values):

----
/server add name irc.server.org -password=oauth:XXXX
/connect name
----

[[irc_sasl]]
=== How can I be identified before joining channels?

If the server supports SASL, you should use that instead of sending the
command for nickserv authentication, for example:

----
/set irc.server.libera.sasl_username "mynick"
/set irc.server.libera.sasl_password "xxxxxxx"
----

If the server does not support SASL, you can add a delay (between command and
join of channels):

----
/set irc.server.libera.command_delay 5
----

[[edit_autojoin]]
=== How can I add/remove channels from autojoin option?

With WeeChat ≥ 3.5, you can automatically record the channels you manually
join and part in the "autojoin" server option.

For all servers:

----
/set irc.server_default.autojoin_dynamic on
----

For a single server:

----
/set irc.server.libera.autojoin_dynamic on
----

You can also add the current channel in the "autojoin" server option using the
`/autojoin` command:

----
/autojoin add
----

Or another channel:

----
/autojoin add #test
----

There are also scripts:

----
/script search autojoin
----

[[ignore_vs_filter]]
=== What is the difference between the /ignore and /filter commands?

The `/ignore` command is an IRC command, so it applies only for IRC buffers
(servers and channels).
It lets you ignore some nicks or hostnames of users for a server or channel
(command will not apply on content of messages).
Matching messages are deleted by IRC plugin before display (so you'll
never see them, and can't be recovered by removing the ignore).

The `/filter` command is a WeeChat core command, so it applies to any buffer.
It lets you filter some lines in buffers with tags or regular expression for
prefix and content of line.
Filtered lines are only hidden, not deleted, and you can see them if you
disable filters (by default, the key kbd:[Alt+=] toggles filters).

[[filter_irc_join_part_quit]]
=== How can I filter join/part/quit and other annoying messages on IRC channels?

See link:weechat_user.en.html#irc_smart_filter[User's guide / IRC smart filter ^↗^^].

[[filter_irc_join_channel_messages]]
=== How can I filter some messages displayed when I join an IRC channel?

You can choose which messages are displayed when joining a channel with the
option _irc.look.display_join_message_ (see `+/help irc.look.display_join_message+`
for more info).

To hide messages (but keep them in buffer), you can filter them using the tag
(for example _irc_329_ for channel creation date). See `/help filter` for help
with filters.

[[filter_voice_messages]]
=== How can I filter voice messages (eg on Bitlbee server)?

It's not easy to filter voice messages, because voice mode can be set with other
modes in same IRC message.

If you want to do that, it's probably because Bitlbee is using voice to show
away users, and you are flooded with voice messages. Therefore, you can change
that and let WeeChat use a special color for away nicks in nicklist.

For Bitlbee ≥ 3, issue this on control channel _&bitlbee_:

----
channel set show_users online,away
----

For older version of Bitlbee, issue this on control channel _&bitlbee_:

----
set away_devoice false
----

For checking away nicks in WeeChat, see question about
<<color_away_nicks,away nicks>>.

If you really want to filter voice messages, you can use this command, but this
is not perfect (will work only if first mode changed is voice):

----
/filter add hidevoices * irc_mode (\+|\-)v
----

[[color_away_nicks]]
=== How can I see away nicks in nicklist?

You have to set option _irc.server_default.away_check_ to a positive value
(minutes between each check of away nicks).

You can set option _irc.server_default.away_check_max_nicks_ to limit away check
on small channels only.

For example, check every 5 minutes for away nicks, for channels with max 25
nicks:

----
/set irc.server_default.away_check 5
/set irc.server_default.away_check_max_nicks 25
----

[[highlight_notification]]
=== How can I be warned when someone highlights me on a channel?

There is a default trigger "beep" which sends a _BEL_ to the terminal on
a highlight or private message. Thus you can configure your terminal
(or multiplexer like screen/tmux) to run a command or play a sound when
a _BEL_ occurs.

Or you can add a command in "beep" trigger:

----
/set trigger.trigger.beep.command "/print -beep;/exec -bg /path/to/command arguments"
----

With an older WeeChat, you can use a script like _beep.pl_ or _launcher.pl_.

For _launcher.pl_, you have to setup a command:

----
/set plugins.var.perl.launcher.signal.weechat_highlight "/path/to/command arguments"
----

Other scripts on this subject:

----
/script search notify
----

[[disable_highlights_for_specific_nicks]]
=== How can I disable highlights for specific nicks?

You can use the
link:weechat_user.en.html#max_hotlist_level_nicks[hotlist_max_level_nicks_add ^↗^^]
buffer property to set the max hotlist level for some nicks, per buffer,
or per group of buffers (like IRC servers).

To only disable highlights, you'd have to set it to 2.

For the current buffer:

----
/buffer setauto hotlist_max_level_nicks_add joe:2,mike:2
----

For all channels on server "libera":

----
/set weechat.buffer.irc.libera.*.hotlist_max_level_nicks_add joe:2,mike:2
----

[[irc_target_buffer]]
=== How can I change target buffer for commands on merged buffers (like buffer with servers)?

The default key is kbd:[Ctrl+x] (command is: `+/buffer switch+`).

[[plugins_scripts]]
== Plugins / scripts

[[openbsd_plugins]]
=== I'm using OpenBSD and WeeChat does not load any plugins, what's wrong?

Under OpenBSD, plugin filenames end with ".so.0.0" (".so" for Linux).

You must set that up:

----
/set weechat.plugin.extension ".so.0.0"
/plugin autoload
----

[[install_scripts]]
=== How can I install scripts? Are scripts compatible with other IRC clients?

You can use the command `/script` to install and manage scripts (see `/help script`
for help).

Scripts are not compatible with other IRC clients.

[[scripts_update]]
=== The command "/script update" can not read scripts, how to fix that?

First check questions about TLS connection in this FAQ.

If still not working, try to manually delete the scripts file (in your shell):

[source,shell]
----
rm ~/.cache/weechat/script/plugins.xml.gz
----

[NOTE]
If you are not using the XDG directories, the path could be: _~/.weechat/script/plugins.xml.gz_.

And update scripts again in WeeChat:

----
/script update
----

If you still have an error, then you must disable the automatic update of file
in WeeChat and download the file manually outside WeeChat (that means you'll
have to update manually the file yourself to get updates):

* in WeeChat:

----
/set script.scripts.cache_expire -1
----

* in your shell, with curl installed:

[source,shell]
----
cd ~/.cache/weechat/script
curl -O https://weechat.org/files/plugins.xml.gz
----

If you're running macOS and the downloaded file has a size of 0 bytes,
try to set this variable in your shell initialization file or on command line,
before starting WeeChat:

[source,shell]
----
export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES
----

[[spell_dictionaries]]
=== I installed aspell dictionaries on my system, how can I use them without restarting WeeChat?

You have to reload the spell plugin:

----
/plugin reload spell
----

[[settings]]
== Settings

[[editing_config_files]]
=== Can I edit configuration files (*.conf) by hand?

You can, but this is *NOT* recommended.

Command `/set` in WeeChat is recommended:

* You can complete the name and value of option with kbd:[Tab] key
  (or kbd:[Shift+Tab] for partial completion, useful for the name).
* The value is checked, a message is displayed in case of error.
* The value is used immediately, you don't need to restart anything.

If you still want to edit files by hand, you should be careful:

* If you put an invalid value for an option, WeeChat will display an error
  on load and discard the value (the default value for option will be used).
* If WeeChat is running, you'll have to issue the command `/reload`, and if
  some settings were changed but not saved with `/save`, you will lose them.

[[memory_usage]]
=== How can I tweak WeeChat to consume less memory?

You can try following tips to consume less memory:

* Use the latest stable version (it is supposed to have less memory leaks than
  older versions).
* Do not load some plugins if you don't use them, for example: buflist,
  fifo, logger, perl, python, ruby, lua, tcl, guile, javascript, php, spell,
  xfer (used for DCC). See `/help weechat.plugin.autoload`.
* Load only scripts that you really need.
* Do not load system certificates if TLS is *NOT* used: turn off this option:
  _weechat.network.gnutls_ca_system_.
* Reduce value of option _weechat.history.max_buffer_lines_number_ or set value
  of option _weechat.history.max_buffer_lines_minutes_.
* Reduce value of option _weechat.history.max_commands_.

[[cpu_usage]]
=== How can I tweak WeeChat to use less CPU?

You can follow same tips as for <<memory_usage,memory>>, and these ones:

* Hide "nicklist" bar: `/bar hide nicklist` (key: kbd:[Alt+Shift+N]).
* Disable "buflist": `/buflist disable` (key: kbd:[Alt+Shift+B]).
* Remove display of seconds in status bar time:
  `+/set weechat.look.item_time_format "%H:%M"+` (this is the default value).
* Disable real time check of misspelled words in command line (if you enabled it):
  `+/set spell.check.real_time off+`.
* Set the _TZ_ variable (for example: `export TZ="Europe/Paris"`), to prevent
  frequent access to file _/etc/localtime_.

[[security]]
=== I am paranoid about security, which settings could I change to be even more secure?

Disable IRC part and quit messages:

----
/set irc.server_default.msg_part ""
/set irc.server_default.msg_quit ""
----

Disable answers to all CTCP queries:

----
/set irc.ctcp.clientinfo ""
/set irc.ctcp.source ""
/set irc.ctcp.time ""
/set irc.ctcp.version ""
/set irc.ctcp.ping ""
----

With WeeChat < 4.1.0, other CTCP queries were replied by default and must be
disabled as well:

----
/set irc.ctcp.finger ""
/set irc.ctcp.userinfo ""
----

Unload and disable auto-loading of "xfer" plugin (used for IRC DCC):

----
/plugin unload xfer
/set weechat.plugin.autoload "*,!xfer"
----

Define a passphrase and use secured data wherever you can for sensitive data
like passwords: see `/help secure` and `/help` on options
(if you can use secured data, it is written in the help).
See also link:weechat_user.en.html#secured_data[User's guide / Secured data ^↗^^].

For example:

----
/secure passphrase xxxxxxxxxx
/secure set libera_username username
/secure set libera_password xxxxxxxx
/set irc.server.libera.sasl_username "${sec.data.libera_username}"
/set irc.server.libera.sasl_password "${sec.data.libera_password}"
----

[[sharing_config_files]]
=== I want to share my WeeChat configuration, what files should I share and what should I keep private?

You can share configuration files _*.conf_ except the file _sec.conf_ which
contains your passwords ciphered with your passphrase.

Some other files may contain sensitive info like passwords (if they are not
stored in _sec.conf_ with the `/secure` command).

See the link:weechat_user.en.html#files_and_directories[User's guide / Files and directories ^↗^^]
for more information about configuration files.

[[move_to_another_device]]
=== I want to move my WeeChat to another device and keep my config, what should I copy?

First check directories used by WeeChat with this command: `/debug dirs`. +
Directories home/config and home/data must be copied (all files and sub-directories).

For example if you're using XDG directories (default with WeeChat ≥ 3.2),
the directories should be `$HOME/.config/weechat` and `$HOME/.local/share/weechat`. +
If you're using a single directory (default with WeeChat < 3.2), the directory
should be `$HOME/.weechat`.

[IMPORTANT]
The WeeChat version on the new device must be greater than or equal to the version
on the initial device. +
Downgrading WeeChat configuration is *NOT SUPPORTED* and can break it,
leading to unusable WeeChat.

Steps:

. Quit Weechat: `/quit` (or `/upgrade -quit` if you want to resume the session,
  which includes content of all buffers).
. Copy all directories, sub-directories and files to the new device, keeping
  same names and permissions.
. Optional: copy any file outside these directories that you refer to in your
  configuration (it's not recommended to use files outside WeeChat directories).
. Start WeeChat on the new device: `weechat` (or `weechat --upgrade` if you
  saved the session).

[[bug_task_patch]]
=== How should I report bugs, ask for new features or send patches?

See https://weechat.org/about/support/[this page ^↗^^].

[[gdb_error_threads]]
=== When I run WeeChat under gdb, there is an error about threads, what can I do?

When you run WeeChat under gdb, you may have this error:

[source,shell]
----
$ gdb /path/to/weechat
(gdb) run
[Thread debugging using libthread_db enabled]
Cannot find new threads: generic error
----

To fix that, you can run gdb with this command (replace path to libpthread and
WeeChat with paths on your system):

[source,shell]
----
$ LD_PRELOAD=/lib/libpthread.so.0 gdb /path/to/weechat
(gdb) run
----

[[supported_os]]
=== What is the list of supported platforms for WeeChat? Will it be ported to other operating systems?

WeeChat runs fine on most Linux/BSD distributions, GNU/Hurd, Mac OS and Windows
(Cygwin and Windows Subsystem for Linux).

We do our best to run on as many platforms as possible. Help is welcome for
some OS' we don't have, to test WeeChat.

[[help_developers]]
=== I want to help WeeChat developers. What can I do?

There are many tasks to do (testing, code, documentation, etc.)
