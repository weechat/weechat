        raw
        sslcertkey

         list: list relay clients (only active relays)
     listfull: list relay clients (verbose, all relays)
    listrelay: list relays (name and port)
          add: add a relay (listen on a port/path)
          del: remove a relay (clients remain connected)
        start: listen on port
      restart: close the server socket and listen again on port (clients remain connected)
         stop: close the server socket (clients remain connected)
         name: relay name (see format below)
         port: port used for relay
         path: path used for relay (for UNIX domain socket only); "%h" at beginning of string is replaced by WeeChat home ("~/.weechat" by default), content is evaluated (see /help eval)
          raw: open buffer with raw Relay data
   sslcertkey: set SSL certificate/key using path in option relay.network.ssl_cert_key

Relay name is: [ipv4.][ipv6.][ssl.]<protocol.name> or unix.[ssl.]<protocol.name>
         ipv4: force use of IPv4
         ipv6: force use of IPv6
          ssl: enable SSL
         unix: use UNIX domain socket
protocol.name: protocol and name to relay:
                 - protocol "irc": name is the server to share (optional, if not given, the server name must be sent by client in command "PASS", with format: "PASS server:password")
                 - protocol "weechat" (name is not used)

The "irc" protocol allows any IRC client (including WeeChat itself) to connect on the port.
The "weechat" protocol allows a remote interface to connect on the port, see the list here: https://weechat.org/about/interfaces

Without argument, this command opens buffer with list of relay clients.

Examples:
  irc proxy, for server "freenode":
    /relay add irc.freenode 8000
  irc proxy, for server "freenode", with SSL:
    /relay add ssl.irc.freenode 8001
  irc proxy, for all servers (client will choose), with SSL:
    /relay add ssl.irc 8002
  weechat protocol:
    /relay add weechat 9000
  weechat protocol with SSL:
    /relay add ssl.weechat 9001
  weechat protocol with SSL, using only IPv4:
    /relay add ipv4.ssl.weechat 9001
  weechat protocol with SSL, using only IPv6:
    /relay add ipv6.ssl.weechat 9001
  weechat protocol with SSL, using IPv4 + IPv6:
    /relay add ipv4.ipv6.ssl.weechat 9001
  weechat protocol over UNIX domain socket:
    /relay add unix.weechat %h/relay_socket
