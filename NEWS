WeeChat Release Notes
=====================
Sébastien Helleu <flashcode@flashtux.org>
v0.4.0-dev, 2012-11-02


Version 0.4.0 (under dev!)
--------------------------

Important release notes:

* conditions in bars have changed, and now an expression is evaluated.
  If you have a value with many conditions in a bar, like: `nicklist,active`,
  you must now use an expression like: `${nicklist} && ${active}` (see
  the chapter about bars in the 'WeeChat User's guide').
* IPv6 is now used by default to connect to IRC servers, with fallback to IPv4.
  The option irc.server_default.ipv6 is now "on" by default. If IPv6 is not
  enabled or fails, IPv4 will be used. The "ipv6" option in server is now used
  to disable IPv6 and force IPv4 (if option is turned "off").
* relay is now listening by default on an IPv6 socket (new option
  relay.network.ipv6, on by default), so connections with IPv4 will have
  IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses, like: "::ffff:127.0.0.1" (for "127.0.0.1");
  check that value of option relay.network.allowed_ips supports this mapping,
  or disable IPv6 in relay if you don't plan to use it at all:
** `/set relay.network.ipv6 off`

Version 0.3.9 (2012-09-29)
--------------------------

Important release notes:

* options moved from core (weechat.conf) to irc plugin (irc.conf):
** 'weechat.look.nickmode' moved to 'irc.look.nick_mode' (new type: integer
   with values: none/prefix/action/both)
** 'weechat.look.nickmode_empty' moved to 'irc.look.nick_mode_empty'
* new bar item has been added: 'buffer_modes' and irc option
  'irc.look.item_channel_modes' has been removed; to display irc channel modes
  in status bar (after channel name), you have to manually add the new item
  'buffer_modes' (this is now used by default in status bar items), default
  value for status bar items becomes:
** `/set weechat.bar.status.items "[time],[buffer_count],[buffer_plugin],buffer_number+:+buffer_name+(buffer_modes)+{buffer_nicklist_count}+buffer_filter,[lag],[hotlist],completion,scroll"`
* changes in options for command `/aspell`:
** new option `enable`: enable aspell
** new option `disable`: disable aspell
** new option `toggle`: toggle aspell (new default key: alt+"s")
** option `enable` renamed to `setdict` (set dictionary for current buffer)
** option `disable` renamed to `deldict` (delete dictionary used on current buffer)
** option `dictlist` renamed to `listdict` (show installed dictionaries)
* an horizontal separator has been added between split windows, and two options
  have been added to toggle separators (both are enabled by default):
** 'weechat.look.window_separator_horizontal'
** 'weechat.look.window_separator_vertical'
* new keys were added, use command `/key missing` to add them or `/key listdiff`
  to see differences between your current keys and WeeChat default keys

Version 0.3.8 (2012-06-03)
--------------------------

Important release notes:

* options 'weechat.look.prefix_align_more' and
  'weechat.look.prefix_buffer_align_more' have been converted from type boolean
  to string:
** if the value was on (default), new value is "+" and you can now customize
   this char
** if the value was off, you have to set " " (string with one space)
* option 'weechat.look.paste_max_lines' can now be used with value 0 to detect
  paste with one line (only if terminal "bracketed paste mode" is enabled when
  option 'weechat.look.paste_bracketed' is on); so now the value -1 is used
  to disable paste detection: if your value was 0, you should set it to -1:
** `/set weechat.look.paste_max_lines -1`
* rmodifier "nickserv" has a new default regex which includes option "release"
  for command "/msg nickserv". If you never added/changed rmodifiers, you can
  just reset all rmodifiers (command: `/rmodifier default -yes`).
  If you added/changed some rmodifiers, do it manually with these two commannds:
** `/rmodifier del nickserv`
** `/rmodifier add nickserv history_add,input_text_display 1,4* ^(/(msg|quote) +nickserv +(id|identify|ghost \S+|release \S+) +)(.*)`

Version 0.3.7 (2012-02-26)
--------------------------

Important release notes:

* option `scroll_unread` has been moved from command `/input` to `/window`,
  therefore default command of key alt+"u" has been updated. To bind key with
  new default value:
** `/key bind meta-u /window scroll_unread`
* extended regex is used in filters and irc ignore, so some chars that
  needed escape in past do not need any more (for example `[0-9]\+` becomes
  `[0-9]+`), filters and ignore have to be manually fixed
* option 'weechat.look.highlight_regex' becomes case insensitive by default,
  to make it case sensitive, use "(?-i)" at beginning of string, for example:
  "(?-i)FlashCode|flashy"
* option 'weechat.history.max_lines' has been renamed to
  'weechat.history.max_buffer_lines_number'
* option 'weechat.plugin.extension' now supports list of extensions, and new
  default value is ".so,.dll" (with this value, weechat.conf is compatible with
  Cygwin)

Version 0.3.6 (2011-10-22)
--------------------------

Important release notes:

* bold is not used any more for basic colors (used only if terminal has less
  than 16 colors), a new option has been added to force bold if needed:
  'weechat.look.color_basic_force_bold'
* option 'weechat.look.hline_char' has been renamed to
  'weechat.look.separator_horizontal'

Version 0.3.5 (2011-05-15)
--------------------------

Important release notes:

* if you have some colors defined in section "palette" with version 0.3.4, you
  should remove all colors defined, and add new aliases (it's not needed any
  more to add colors before using them)
* colors for nick prefixes (char for op, voice, ..) are defined in a single
  option 'irc.color.nick_prefixes', therefore following options will be lost:
  'irc.color.nick_prefix_op', 'irc.color.nick_prefix_halfop',
  'irc.color.nick_prefix_voice', 'irc.color.nick_prefix_user'
* count of messages have been added to hotlist by default, if you want to come
  back to old behaviour, do that:
** `/set weechat.look.hotlist_count_max 0`
** `/set weechat.look.hotlist_buffer_separator ","`
* when you are away, all buffers are now added to hotlist by default (even if
  they are displayed in a window), if you want to come back to old behaviour, do
  that:
** `/set weechat.look.hotlist_add_buffer_if_away off`
* new keys were added, use command `/key missing` to add them or `/key listdiff`
  to see differences between your current keys and WeeChat default keys

Version 0.3.4 (2011-01-16)
--------------------------

Important release notes:

* if you are using `/upgrade` from a previous release:
** some nick prefixes can be wrong, so it is recommended to do `/allchan names`
** nick colors are defined with a new option 'weechat.color.chat_nick_colors',
   therefore old options 'weechat.color.chat_nick_color1..10' will be lost when
   upgrading
** nick colors in messages displayed will be wrong if you changed some nick colors
   (old default colors will be used)
* some IRC options have been renamed, before upgrading to this version, note
  value for old options, and set them again with new name:
** options moved from 'network' section to servers (with global value, and server
   value, like other server options):
*** 'irc.network.connection_timeout' moved to 'irc.server_default.connection_timeout'
*** 'irc.network.anti_flood_prio_high' moved to 'irc.server_default.anti_flood_prio_high'
*** 'irc.network.anti_flood_prio_low' moved to 'irc.server_default.anti_flood_prio_low'
*** 'irc.network.away_check' moved to 'irc.server_default.away_check'
*** 'irc.network.away_check_max_nicks' moved to 'irc.server_default.away_check_max_nicks'
*** 'irc.network.default_msg_part' moved to 'irc.server_default.default_msg_part'
*** 'irc.network.default_msg_quit' moved to 'irc.server_default.default_msg_quit'
** other IRC options renamed:
*** 'irc.look.open_channel_near_server' moved to 'irc.look.new_channel_position'
    (old option was boolean, new is integer with value as string)
*** 'irc.look.open_pv_near_server' moved to 'irc.look.new_pv_position'
    (old option was boolean, new is integer with value as string)

Version 0.3.3 (2010-08-07)
--------------------------

Important release notes:

* if you are using `/upgrade` from a previous release, then you must reconnect
  to IRC servers in order to use new command /wallchops.
* option 'irc.network.lag_min_show' is now in milliseconds, you should set new
  value: your current value multiplied by 1000 (new default value is 500).

Version 0.3.2 (2010-04-18)
--------------------------

If you are using `/upgrade` from a previous release, then you must execute this
command on all IRC servers/channels/private buffers and xfer DCC chats (not
needed on WeeChat core buffer or buffers from other plugins/scripts): +
`/buffer set highlight_words $nick`

Version 0.3.1.1 (2010-01-31)

Version 0.2.6 (2007-09-06)
--------------------------

No release note.

Version 0.2.5 (2007-06-07)

Version 0.2.4 (2007-03-29)
--------------------------

All users of version 0.2.2 should upgrade to this version.

Version 0.2.2 (2007-01-06)
--------------------------

Important release notes:

* new charset plugin:
** for users of any previous version, all your charset settings in weechat.rc
   will be LOST! You should save your weechat.rc to keep your values and set
   them again with new 'charset' plugin.
** for ISO users: history of channels may be without accents (after `/upgrade`),
   this is not recoverable, but this is not a bug. All new messages should be
   ok.
** be careful, now default encode is UTF-8 for all channels (before it was
   terminal charset). If you still want to send messages as 'ISO-8859-1', you
   should send either global encode or server specific encode to 'ISO-8859-1':
*** for global encode: `/setp charset.global.encode = "ISO-8859-1"`
*** for server encode (on server buffer): `/charset encode ISO-8859-1`
* new keys for topic scroll:
** new keys for scrolling topic: F9/F10
** key F10 was used for `infobar_clear` in previous WeeChat versions,
   you have to manually rebind this key (except for new WeeChat users):
*** `/key <press alt+"k" then F10> scroll_topic_right` (which gives something
    like: `/key meta2-21~ scroll_topic_right`).

Version 0.2.1 (2006-10-01)
--------------------------

No release note.

Version 0.2.0 (2006-08-19)
--------------------------

Important release notes:

* if you upgraded with `/upgrade` in WeeChat, you should `/disconnect` and then
  `/reconnect` on each server, to display properly channel/user modes.
* if you're using plugins, you should remove some old plugins libraries in
  WeeChat system library directory (commonly '/usr/local/lib/weechat/plugins'):
  remove `lib*` files (like `libperl.*`, `libpython.*`, ..) and keep only new
  libraries (`perl.*`, `python.*`, ..).

Version 0.1.9 (2006-05-25)
--------------------------

Important release notes:

* please close all DCC chat buffers before using /upgrade command, otherwise you
  may experience problems with DCC chats.
* some changes in script API: now timer handlers functions takes exactly
  0 (zero) argument (in version 0.1.8, two arguments were mandatory but not
  used: server and args).

Version 0.1.8 (2006-03-18)
--------------------------

Important release notes:

* it is recommended for users of version 0.1.7 (or any older), to
  replace values in setup file ('~/.weechat/weechat.rc'):
** option: log_path: replace '~/.weechat/logs' by '%h/logs'
** option: plugins_path: replace '~/.weechat/plugins' by '%h/plugins' +
   '%h' is replaced by WeeChat home (default: '~/.weechat', may be overriden
   by new command line arg `--dir`).
* after installing 0.1.8 (or with `/upgrade`), issue both commands (if you
  didn't redefine these keys (alt+{home|end}):
** `/key unbind meta-meta2-1~`
** `/key unbind meta-meta2-4~`
** then launch again WeeChat (or issue `/upgrade`).
* Keys alt+{home|end} were used for nicklist scroll, they're now replaced by
  alt+{F11|F12}.

Version 0.1.7 (2006-01-14)
--------------------------

Important release notes:

* Ruby script plugin has been added but is experimental in this release.
  You're warned!
* `/away` command was changed to be RFC 2812 compliant. Now argument is required
  to set away, and no argument means remove away ("back"). Option
  'irc_default_msg_away' has been removed.

Version 0.1.6 (2005-11-11)
--------------------------

Important release notes:

* incompatibility with some old scripts: now all handlers have to return a code
  for completion, and to do some actions about message to ignore (please look at
  documentation for detail).
* on OpenBSD, the new option 'plugins_extension' should be set to '.so.0.0'
  since the plugins names are ending by '.so.0.0' and not '.so'.
* with new and full UTF-8 support, the option 'look_charset_internal' should be
  set to blank for most cases. Forces it only if your locale is not properly
  detected by WeeChat (you can set 'UTF-8' or 'ISO-8859-15' for example,
  depending on your locale). WeeChat is looking for 'UTF-8' in your locale name
  at startup.
