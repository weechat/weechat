# - Find Ruby
# This module finds if Ruby is installed and determines where the include files
# and libraries are. It also determines what the name of the library is. This
# code sets the following variables:
#
#  RUBY_INCLUDE_DIRS = C flags to compile with ruby
#  RUBY_LIBRARY_DIRS = linker flags to compile with ruby (found with pkg-config)
#  RUBY_LIB          = ruby library (found without pkg-config)

if(RUBY_FOUND)
  # Already in cache, be silent
  set(RUBY_FIND_QUIETLY TRUE)
