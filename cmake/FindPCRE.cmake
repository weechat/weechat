# - Find PCRE
# This module finds if libpcre and libpcreposix are installed and determines where
# the include files and libraries are.
#
# This code sets the following variables:
#
#  PCRE_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where <pcre.h> can be found
#  PCRE_LIBRARY = path to where libpcre.so* can be found
#  PCREPOSIX_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where <pcreposix.h> can be found
#  PCREPOSIX_LIBRARY = path to where libpcreposix.so* can be found
#  PCRE_CFLAGS = cflags to use to compile
#  PCRE_LDFLAGS = ldflags to use to compile

if(PCRE_INCLUDE_PATH AND PCRE_LIBRARY)
   # Already in cache, be silent
