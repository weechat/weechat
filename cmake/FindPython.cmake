# - Find Python
# This module finds if Python is installed and determines where the include files
# and libraries are. It also determines what the name of the library is. This
# code sets the following variables:
#
#  PYTHON_EXECUTABLE   = full path to the python binary
#  PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS = path to where python.h can be found
#  PYTHON_LIBRARIES = path to where libpython.so* can be found
#  PYTHON_LDFLAGS = python compiler options for linking
