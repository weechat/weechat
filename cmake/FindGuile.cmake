# - Find Guile
# This module finds if Guile is installed and determines where the include files
# and libraries are. It also determines what the name of the library is. This
# code sets the following variables:
#
# GUILE_FOUND        = Guile is installed
# GUILE_INCLUDE_DIRS = Guile include directory
# GUILE_LIBRARIES    = Link options to compile Guile

if(GUILE_FOUND)
  # Already in cache, be silent
  set(GUILE_FIND_QUIETLY TRUE)
endif()
