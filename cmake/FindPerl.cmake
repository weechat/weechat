# - Find Perl libraries
# This module finds if Perl is installed and determines where the include files
# and libraries are. It also determines what the name of the library is. This
# code sets the following variables:
#
#  PERL_EXECUTABLE   = full path to the perl binary
#  PERL_INCLUDE_PATH = path to where perl.h can be found
#  PERL_LIBRARY = path to where libperl.so* can be found
#  PERL_CFLAGS = perl compiler options for compiling
#  PERL_LFLAGS = perl compiler options for linking

if(PERL_FOUND)
  # Already in cache, be silent
  set(PERL_FIND_QUIETLY TRUE)
endif()
